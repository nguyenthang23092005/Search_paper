    "abstract": "An experimental study had been conducted to study of substituting natural coarse aggregate with different proportions of crushed brick aggregate impacts the compressive strength of concrete. The study aims to compare the compressive strength of nominal mixed M15, M20 and M25 grade concrete by replacing stone aggregate with crushed bricks aggregate with volumetric replacement (0%,25%,50%,75% and 100%) also find the relation between the results of NDT and destructive test. A total of 45 number of concrete mixes specimens are casted with and without crushed bricks. These specimens were tested at 28 days for compressive strength. In this paper experimental research has been carried out involving both destructive with universal testing machine and non-destructive test with rebound hammer test. The result indicated that using crushed bricks reduces the strength of concrete. The research emphasizes reusing bricks which reduces waste and enhance recourse recycling and conservation.",

    "title": "Crack detection in powder compacts using machine learning models",
    "abstract": "Purpose Cracks in powder metallurgy (PM) components, being a common problem, pose significant manufacturing challenges but are detrimental to be detected as they affect the material’s mechanical properties. To detect these cracks, non-destructive testing (NDTs) methods are often used, but they come with high costs and time delays, as samples need to be extracted from production at given intervals. To overcome these limitations, an indirect method of crack detection, that is, modelling it as a binary classification, is explored in this work. Design/methodology/approach This study introduces a supervised machine learning (ML) approach using force signal feature extraction to detect cracks. More specifically, a supervised learning algorithm is developed and validated for the classification of samples into samples with or without cracks based on the sensory data of the hydraulic press used for production. We compare different ensemble classifiers, including random forest (RF), AdaBoost (ADA), bagging, gradient boosting (GB) and extra trees (ET), in terms of their ability to classify workpieces using a dataset from real production. Findings To this end, the present study deals with experimental workpieces of a specific type produced by manually adjusting the press parameters to artificially induce cracks in parts of the workpieces. The best-performing model resulted in a classification accuracy as high as 99% offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional NDT methods. Originality/value This study provides a novel and indirect method for detecting cracks in PM components using ML models trained on press sensor data, which can significantly reduce the need for costly and time-consuming NDT techniques.",

    "abstract": "Stone cultural heritage structures built from pyroclastic rocks are susceptible to deterioration due to their sensitivity to atmospheric processes. Detecting such deterioration and periodically examining it using non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques is one of the most critical measures for ensuring its transmission to future generations. In recent years, assessing the properties of building stones through NDT methods has been widely applied in planning the preservation of stone cultural heritages. In this study, deterioration observed on the interior walls of the Emir Ali Tomb, a structure distinguished from other tombs in the region by its exceptional architecture, was investigated through laboratory tests and NDT techniques, including deep moisture measurement, P-wave velocity, and infrared thermography. It was determined that the monument was constructed from four different types of pyroclastic rock, classified according to their textural and geomechanical characteristics. Using data obtained from in situ tests, NDT distribution maps were generated. The deep moisture, P-wave velocity, and infrared thermography maps revealed that the primary cause of deterioration in the monument was related to capillary water rise.",

    "title": "TWO-STAGE BAYESIAN INFERENCE FOR RAIL MODEL UPDATING AND CRACK DETECTION WITH ULTRASONIC GUIDED WAVE MEASUREMENTS",
    "abstract": "Railway infrastructure is highly susceptible to fatigue-induced cracks, which, if undetected, may lead to catastrophic derailments and significant economic losses. Conventional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods effectively identify surface-level damage but often fail to detect internal or small-scale cracks. Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) offer deeper penetration and long-range detection but face challenges in mode selection, noise interference, and uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage Bayesian inference framework that integrates UGW measurements with deep learning–based segmentation. In the first stage, Bayesian model updating using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) refines rail material parameters, incorporating prior knowledge and UGW data for accurate wave propagation modeling. In the second stage, a Bayesian U-Net with Monte Carlo Dropout is employed to achieve pixel-level crack segmentation while providing uncertainty-aware predictions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian U-Net achieves superior performance (IoU = 0.82, Dice Score = 0.88, Pixel Accuracy = 95.2%) compared to traditional U-Net and Mask R-CNN, while maintaining robustness under noisy conditions with only a 7.3% performance drop. Furthermore, the integration of segmentation into Bayesian updating reduces mean squared error from 0.042 to 0.018, highlighting the framework’s accuracy and reliability. The results confirm that combining Bayesian inference with deep learning significantly improves crack localization, uncertainty quantification, and computational efficiency, providing a practical solution for real-world rail structural health monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Anemia caused by gastrointestinal parasitism is a major constraint to small ruminant productivity, particularly in low-resource production systems where diagnostic tools and veterinary access are limited. This study evaluated the potential of radiofrequency non distructive technique (RF-NDT) wave derived features as non-invasive biomarkers for anemia detection in goats, using FAMACHA© scores as a biological reference. Variable clustering of the top ten frequencies revealed distinct patterns across health states. Healthy animals (FAMACHA© 1) were characterized by a single frequency cluster centered at 8.43 GHz, explaining 93.7% of variation, whereas moderately affected animals (FAMACHA© 2) shifted to 9.33 GHz with reduced uniformity (88.7%). Borderline animals (FAMACHA© 3) required two clusters (9.89 and 8.23 GHz), explaining 91.0% of variation, indicating increasing tissue heterogeneity with anemia progression. Regression analysis demonstrated strong predictive power, with Linear Regression achieving R² = 1.00 and Random Forest R² = 0.79 (RMSE = 0.07), while Support Vector Regression underperformed (R² = 0.31). Classification models confirmed the feasibility of categorical anemia detection. The Multilayer Perceptron achieved the highest accuracy (0.84), F1-score (0.83), and ROC-AUC (0.94), outperforming Support Vector Machine (accuracy 0.67, F1 = 0.67) and K-Nearest Neighbors (accuracy 0.60, F1 = 0.61). These findings establish proof-of-concept that RF waves capture physiologically meaningful dielectric signatures linked to anemia, reflecting hemoglobin concentration, hydration, and microcirculatory function. The integration of RF sensing with machine learning offers a rapid, non-invasive, and scalable diagnostic approach for sustainable herd health management.

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) technology, a new nondestructive testing (NDT) approach with frequencies generally ranging from 100 GHz to 10 THz, has been widely used by virtue of its excellent penetration and high spatial–temporal resolution for non-metallic materials. However, in the process of characterizing the thickness of glass fiber-reinforced composite (GFRP) laminate along the THz propagation direction, the dispersion effect of the material will severely affect the accuracy of thickness measurement. In this work, in order to reduce the influence of the dispersion effect and improve thickness estimation accuracy, a THz dispersion compensation method based on sparse representation is proposed to accurately estimate the sparse impulse vector from the dispersive THz signal, with thickness measurement accomplished by the dispersion compensation process. Finally, a series of numerical simulations and experiments were implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed THz dispersion compensation method in thickness measurement. It is worth noting that the minimum estimated error in thickness is only 0.11%.",
