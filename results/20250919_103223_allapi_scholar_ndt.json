    "title": "Advances in Nondestructive Technologies for External Eggshell Quality Evaluation",
    "abstract": "The structural integrity of poultry eggs is essential for food safety, economic value, and hatchability. External eggshell quality—measured by thickness, strength, cracks, color, and cleanliness—is a key criterion for grading and sorting. Traditional assessment methods, although simple, suffer from subjectivity, low efficiency, and destructive nature. In contrast, recent developments in nondestructive testing (NDT) technologies have enabled precise, automated, and real-time evaluation of eggshell characteristics. This review systematically summarizes state-of-the-art NDT techniques including acoustic resonance, ultrasonic imaging, terahertz spectroscopy, machine vision, and electrical property sensing. Deep learning and sensor fusion methods are highlighted for their superior accuracy in microcrack detection (up to 99.4%) and shell strength prediction. We further discuss emerging challenges such as noise interference, signal variability, and scalability for industrial deployment. The integration of explainable AI, multimodal data acquisition, and edge computing is proposed as a future direction to develop intelligent, scalable, and cost-effective eggshell inspection systems. This comprehensive analysis provides a valuable reference for advancing nondestructive quality control in poultry product supply chains.",

    "title": "A baseline-free damage localization method for multisource excited crosstalk using mixed copula function",
    "abstract": "Abstract Nondestructive testing (NDT) systems are critical for structural lifecycle management, yet existing algorithms struggle to address the challenges of distributed multisource systems, particularly crosstalk interference during large-area inspections. This study introduces an innovative damage detection and localization method tailored for fiber-based distributed ultrasonic excitation that uniquely enables lightweight, large-area coverage through multipoint excitation via a single optical fiber. To overcome the limitations of conventional approaches in handling distributed signal correlations, we propose a hybrid binary Copula framework that optimizes Copula hybridization to minimize fitting errors and precisely characterize signal dependencies. This method quantifies damage effects through correlation coefficient analysis and a novel correlation index (CI), synergistically integrated with an energy index (EI) to form a baseline-free damage index (DI) that amplifies damage-induced signal variations. By eliminating the reliance on baseline data, this approach addresses a major bottleneck in scalable NDT applications. Experimental validation on a 2000 mm × 1000 mm × 0.5 mm aluminum plate demonstrated the system’s high-precision capability, successfully locating three coexisting damages with an average absolute error of 3.83 mm (0.31% relative error). The fusion of hybrid Copula modeling and baseline-independent quantification establishes a paradigm shift for distributed NDT systems, balancing expansive coverage with sub-centimeter accuracy, which is a critical advancement in next-generation infrastructure maintenance.&amp;#xD;",

    "title": "Development Trend in Non-Destructive Techniques for Cultural Heritage: From Material Characterization to AI-Driven Diagnosis",
    "abstract": "Cultural heritage (CH) relics are irreplaceable records of human civilization, encompassing diverse historical, technological, and artistic achievements. Extracting their structural and compositional information without affecting their physical integrity is a critical challenge. This review summarizes recent advances in non-destructive techniques (NDTs) for CH analysis and emphasizes the balance between the depth of analysis and conservation ethics. Techniques are broadly categorized into spectrum-based, X-ray-based, and digital-based methods. Spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provide molecular-level insights into organic and inorganic components, often requiring minimal or no sampling. X-ray-based techniques, including conventional and spatially resolved XRD/XRF and total reflection XRF (TRXRF), provide powerful means for crystal and elemental analysis, including in situ pigment identification and trace material analysis. Digital-based methods include high-resolution imaging, three-dimensional modeling, data fusion, and AI-driven diagnosis to achieve the non-invasive visualization, monitoring, and virtual restoration of CH assets. This review highlights a methodology shift from traditional molecular-level detection to data-centric and AI-assisted diagnosis, reflecting the paradigm shift in heritage science.",

    "abstract": "Advanced metal-based nanomaterials (MBNs) represent a dynamic frontier in nanomedicine, offering a versatile platform for next-generation diagnostics and therapeutics. Their tunable structures and catalytic, optical, and magnetic properties enable diverse nanodynamic therapies (NDTs), including photodynamic, chemodynamic, sonodynamic, thermodynamic, piezoelectric, radiodynamic, and magnetodynamic modalities. In addition to the well-established tumor ablation, MBNs also feature potent antimicrobial and antiviral activity, functioning via reactive oxygen species generation, immune modulation, and biofilm disruption. Recent developments in metal-organic frameworks, metal-phenolic networks, and 2D metal nanosheets have expanded the toolkit for precision drug delivery, imaging-guided therapy, and bioresponsive release strategies. This comprehensive review highlights the structural design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and versatile biomedical applications of emerging MBN platforms, emphasizing synergistic treatment strategies and their role in overcoming hypoxia, multidrug resistance, and immunosuppression. Despite their promise, clinical translation remains hindered by unresolved issues in long-term biosafety, biodegradation, and scalable manufacturing. Future efforts are expected to focus on tailoring intelligent nanostructures with optimized pharmacokinetics, integrating multimodal imaging with real-time therapeutic feedback, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Continued innovation at the interface of materials science, biology, and medicine will be essential for transforming MBN-based systems into clinically viable tools for oncology, infectious disease control, and personalized medicine.",

    "title": "Review of Non-Destructive Testing for Wind Turbine Bolts",
    "abstract": "As the world increasingly gravitates towards green, environmentally friendly and low-carbon lifestyles, wind power has become one of the most technologically established renewable energy sources. However, with the continuous increase in their output power and height, wind turbine towers are subjected to higher-intensity alternating wind loads. This makes critical components more prone to fatigue failure, potentially leading to major accidents such as tower buckling or turbine collapse. High-strength bolts play a vital role in supporting towers but are susceptible to fatigue crack initiation under long-term cyclic loading, necessitating regular inspection. Types of wind turbine bolts mainly include high-strength bolts, stainless steel bolts, anchor bolts, titanium alloy bolts, and adjustable bolts. These bolts are distributed across different parts of the turbine and perform distinct functions. Among them, high-strength bolts in the tower are particularly critical for structural support, demanding prioritized periodic inspection. Compared to destructive offline inspection methods requiring bolt disassembly, non-destructive testing (NDT) has emerged as a trend in defect detection technologies. Therefore, this review comprehensively examines various types of NDT techniques for wind turbine towers’ high-strength bolts, including disassembly inspection techniques (magnetic particle inspection, penetration inspection, intelligent torque inspection, etc.) and non-disassembly inspection techniques (ultrasonic inspection, radiographic inspection, infrared thermographic inspection, etc.). For each technique, we analyze the fundamental principles, technical characteristics, and limitations, while emphasizing the interconnections between the methodologies. Finally, we discuss potential future research directions for bolt defect NDT technologies.",

    "abstract": "The integration of digital twinning technologies is driving next-generation\nnetworks toward new capabilities, allowing operators to thoroughly understand\nnetwork conditions, efficiently analyze valuable radio data, and innovate\napplications through user-friendly, immersive interfaces. Building on this\nfoundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational\nprocesses and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive\nmanagement through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing\nprecise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources,\nmapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining\nscalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on\nthe creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and\ninter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT)\nframework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer,\nmerging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging\njoint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource\nutilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model\nconsistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is\nconducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated\naggregation process. Evaluations on real-world twin-assisted applications, such\nas trajectory reconstruction, human localization, and sensory data generation,\ndemonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of interoperability among NDTs\nfor corresponding task development.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)\nwith Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation\nlearning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have\ndemonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their\nuse for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely\nunexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as\nnon-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where\nlabeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We\npropose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic\nultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that\nenhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)\nclassification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model\nsize, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream\naccuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform\nmodels trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbaselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on\nsynthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured\nsignals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study\nunderscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis\nthrough scalable, self-supervised learning.",

    "abstract": "Active Infrared thermography (AIRT) is a widely adopted non-destructive\ntesting (NDT) technique for detecting subsurface anomalies in industrial\ncomponents. Due to the high dimensionality of AIRT data, current approaches\nemploy non-linear autoencoders (AEs) for dimensionality reduction. However, the\nlatent space learned by AIRT AEs lacks structure, limiting their effectiveness\nin downstream defect characterization tasks. To address this limitation, this\npaper proposes a principal component analysis guided (PCA-guided) autoencoding\nframework for structured dimensionality reduction to capture intricate,\nnon-linear features in thermographic signals while enforcing a structured\nlatent space. A novel loss function, PCA distillation loss, is introduced to\nguide AIRT AEs to align the latent representation with structured PCA\ncomponents while capturing the intricate, non-linear patterns in thermographic\nsignals. To evaluate the utility of the learned, structured latent space, we\npropose a neural network-based evaluation metric that assesses its suitability\nfor defect characterization.

    "abstract": "Future networks, such as 6G, will need to support a vast and diverse range of\ninterconnected devices and applications, each with its own set of requirements.\nWhile traditional network management approaches will suffice, an automated\nsolutions are becoming a must. However, network automation frameworks are prone\nto errors, and often they employ ML-based techniques that require training to\nlearn how the network can be optimized. In this sense, network digital twins\nare a useful tool that allows for the simulation, testing, and training of AI\nmodels without affecting the real-world networks and users. This paper presents\nan AI-based Network Digital Twin (AI-NDT) that leverages a multi-layered\nknowledge graph architecture and graph neural networks to predict network\nmetrics that directly affect the quality of experience of users.
