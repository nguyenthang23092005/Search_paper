    "title": "Advances in Nondestructive Technologies for External Eggshell Quality Evaluation",
    "abstract": "The structural integrity of poultry eggs is essential for food safety, economic value, and hatchability. External eggshell quality—measured by thickness, strength, cracks, color, and cleanliness—is a key criterion for grading and sorting. Traditional assessment methods, although simple, suffer from subjectivity, low efficiency, and destructive nature. In contrast, recent developments in nondestructive testing (NDT) technologies have enabled precise, automated, and real-time evaluation of eggshell characteristics. This review systematically summarizes state-of-the-art NDT techniques including acoustic resonance, ultrasonic imaging, terahertz spectroscopy, machine vision, and electrical property sensing. Deep learning and sensor fusion methods are highlighted for their superior accuracy in microcrack detection (up to 99.4%) and shell strength prediction. We further discuss emerging challenges such as noise interference, signal variability, and scalability for industrial deployment. The integration of explainable AI, multimodal data acquisition, and edge computing is proposed as a future direction to develop intelligent, scalable, and cost-effective eggshell inspection systems. This comprehensive analysis provides a valuable reference for advancing nondestructive quality control in poultry product supply chains.",

    "title": "On Transferring, Merging, and Splitting Task-Oriented Network Digital\n  Twins",
    "abstract": "The integration of digital twinning technologies is driving next-generation\nnetworks toward new capabilities, allowing operators to thoroughly understand\nnetwork conditions, efficiently analyze valuable radio data, and innovate\napplications through user-friendly, immersive interfaces. Building on this\nfoundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational\nprocesses and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive\nmanagement through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing\nprecise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources,\nmapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining\nscalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on\nthe creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and\ninter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT)\nframework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer,\nmerging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging\njoint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource\nutilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model\nconsistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is\nconducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated\naggregation process. Evaluations on real-world twin-assisted applications, such\nas trajectory reconstruction, human localization, and sensory data generation,\ndemonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of interoperability among NDTs\nfor corresponding task development.",
