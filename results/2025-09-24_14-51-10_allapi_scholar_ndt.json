    "title": "Accurate Thickness Characterization of Glass Fiber-Reinforced Composites Using Terahertz Dispersion Compensation Method Based on Sparse Representation",
    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) technology, a new nondestructive testing (NDT) approach with frequencies generally ranging from 100 GHz to 10 THz, has been widely used by virtue of its excellent penetration and high spatial–temporal resolution for non-metallic materials. However, in the process of characterizing the thickness of glass fiber-reinforced composite (GFRP) laminate along the THz propagation direction, the dispersion effect of the material will severely affect the accuracy of thickness measurement. In this work, in order to reduce the influence of the dispersion effect and improve thickness estimation accuracy, a THz dispersion compensation method based on sparse representation is proposed to accurately estimate the sparse impulse vector from the dispersive THz signal, with thickness measurement accomplished by the dispersion compensation process. Finally, a series of numerical simulations and experiments were implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed THz dispersion compensation method in thickness measurement. It is worth noting that the minimum estimated error in thickness is only 0.11%.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted at temperatures of 298.15, 273.15, 253.15, and 233.15 K on three organic electrolytes, composed of 1 m NaPF 6 dissolved in strongly coordinating diglyme (DG), a mixture of DG and weakly coordinating Tetrahydrofuran (THF) with a 2:8 volume ratio, and a mixture of DG, THF, and weakly coordinating 1,3‐dioxolane (DOL) with a 2:4:4 volume ratio, respectively, hereafter denoted as ND, NDT, and NDTD electrolytes for sodium‐ion batteries. The studies indicate strong Na + –DG coordination that leads to a vehicular mechanism, in the sense that Na + persists in migrating together with strongly coordinating DG in the first coordination shell at all the temperature ranges. Such a vehicular mechanism hinders Na + migration in the ND electrolyte. In contrast, the introduction of weakly coordinating molecules, such as THF in the NDT electrolyte and THF/DOL in the NDTD electrolyte, considerably perturbs Na + solvation with various coordinating configurations that include Na + –THF and/or Na + –DOL as well as Na + – contact‐ion pairs. Such diversity of the coordinating configurations significantly improves Na + migration, especially in the NDTD electrolyte, which has the highest ionic conductivity as well as the fractional ionic conductivity of Na + of 3.68 ± 0.36 and 1.32 ± 0.11 mS·cm −1 , respectively, even at a low temperature of 233.15 K.",

    "abstract": "We propose a speed-adapted treadmill that can be incorporated into a rehabilitation trainer that applies neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) for patients with stroke. NDT practice is effective for post-stroke patients, but its requirement for therapists’ participation can limit the patients’ rehabilitation during the golden period of recovery. Previous studies have proposed a trainer that can automatically reiterate therapists’ interventions. However, that trainer employed a constant-speed treadmill, which required the users to frequently adjust their walking speeds during rehabilitation. This paper develops a speed-adapted treadmill that can regulate the treadmill motor to maintain the subject’s position during the training process. First, we derive models of the treadmill and cable motors through experiments. Then, we design robust controls for the two systems and simplify them as proportional-integral-derivative controllers for hardware implementation. Finally, we integrate the system and invite healthy and stroke subjects to participate in clinical experiments. Among ten stroke subjects, all subjects’ walking speeds and nine subjects’ stride lengths were improved, while eight subjects showed improvement in the swing-phase asymmetry and pelvic rotation after receiving the NDT rehabilitation employing the speed-adapted treadmill. Our findings indicate that the NDT trainer effectively enhances users’ gait characteristics, including swing-phase symmetry, pelvic rotation, walking speed, and stride length.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative analysis of a multi-modal non-destructive testing and evaluation program in evaluating the condition of concrete elements in two dam structures in Quebec, Canada. For each dam structure, one area, exhibiting varying degrees of deterioration, were meticulously investigated to evaluate the surface and subsurface integrity of the concrete. Visual surveys revealed surface-level defects, including cracks, spalling, and evidence of previous repairs. Subsurface conditions were evaluated through a multi modal non-destructive evaluation program. Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) was used for rapid screening of the area for potential delamination and voids, particularly in areas with prior repairs. Ultrasonic pulse echo (UPE) was utilized to verify the findings of the GPR scans, providing high-resolution data on internal defects within the top 500 mm. In addition, Impulse-Response (IR) testing was deployed to affirm presence of potential anomalies (voids and delamination) by identifying high-mobility zones. Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) was employed to evaluate mechanical properties, revealing variations in shear wave velocity, with lower velocities correlating to compromised material integrity. The main objective of the study was to study the effectiveness of these NDT-E methods in identifying sub-surface anomalies. The findings of this study revealed a good agreement between among between different assessment methods, enhancing confidence in defect detection and material characterization. While much of the concrete was found to be in satisfactory condition, several areas especially those with prior repairs exhibited notable surface and subsurface degradation. The findings emphasize the need for targeted maintenance and repair strategies to mitigate the identified defects and ensure the long-term safety and performance of the dams. This study showed the efficacy of combining multiple NDE techniques for detailed, non-invasive assessments of dam infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Structural concrete damage evolution can be made by non-destructive testing (NDT) methods. These methods are divided into two subcategories as active and passive methods due to their applications. While defect characteristics are analyzed by measuring the changes in the material caused by externally provided energy in the active methods, passive methods use the energy emitted from the internal processes of the material without using any external source. Even though the test conditions of the passive NDT methods can be controlled, the randomness of the obtained data affects the probability of detection (POD) of the damage inspection. Particularly in concrete, an excessively heterogeneous material, sensor-damage distance and damage characteristics influence the reliability of the inspection procedure. This study aims to investigate the reliability of the passive NDT method for monitoring damage in concrete by focusing on effects of the sensor placement and damage severity. For this, with Acoustic Emission (AE) technique, detection reliability was comprehended on structural bending test of a reinforced concrete beam by signal response-based POD. As the AE parameters such as amplitude and energy are related with the damage severity, both of them were utilized to generate the POD curves with respect to the beam’s deflection. Furthermore, compared to prior studies on concrete damage inspection, Berens model and confidence interval analysis were applied by providing quantitative framework to prove the robustness and sensitivity of the method for detecting even low-load level damage.",

Increased tonnage on contemporary railway tracks, require greater track availability for higher frequency train operations and reduced track closure for track maintenance and repair. As such, train network managers seek ways to employ proactive track maintenance policies, which require timely availability of crucial track data concerning track mechanics, track geometry, track right-of-way, track hydrology and track vegetation as well as track signalization and track electrification. This paper presents an integrated approach combining rough ride alerts, ground penetrating radar and seismic methods to assess the structural health of railway tracks. It details the electromagnetic and mechanical principles underlying these NDT techniques and explores how dielectric and seismic properties of trackbed materials influence their effectiveness. Through analytical insights and field examples, the study demonstrates how the fusion of GPR and seismic data can identify subsurface issues such as ballast fouling, water ingress, and subgrade weakness before they manifest as geometry faults. Case studies highlight the potential of NDT-informed maintenance workflows to diagnose root causes, reduce risk of derailment, and enhance long-term track performance.",

    "abstract": "Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for\nindustrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often\nlack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical\nself-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address\nthese shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based\nagentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive\nX-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent\npositions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,\ncoordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the\nEvidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect\nregion proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through\nNon-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in\nX-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides\nthe LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating\ncontext assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,\nconfidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the\nSDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using\ntools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,\nenhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate\ndiverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset\ndemonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection\nF1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and\ntrustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of\nagentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to linear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of recently developed methods based on counting spectral peaks are reported to be simple, robust but nevertheless very sensitive to nonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied systematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a series of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates. Our data leads to other conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by (usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is not acceptable for a robust method. Moreover, the behavior of the index when the ultrasound amplitude is varied excludes material nonlinearity as a direct and significant contributor to the index value. To clarify the apparent contradiction of our results with the previously published statements, it is recommended that (a) our data is re-evaluated by independent researchers and (b) the experiments already published are repeated or (if sufficient data is available) re-evaluated as well.  - Previousarticle in issue - Nextarticle in issue",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel methodology for mitigating vibration-induced distortions in rail surface defect detection through eddy current testing. We developed a dual-parameter eddy current sensor utilizing the LDC1101 (inductive digital converter). The sensor exploits the fundamental relationship between parallel impedance (RP) and inductance (L) to establish a dual-parameter fusion model that effectively reduces vibration interference during detection. Sensor sensitivity is enhanced through Litz Wire implementation. Our numerical simulations compare the defect detection capabilities of Litz Wire versus single-core coils, while examining the Litz Wire’s response characteristics during dual-parameter detection. These analyses also elucidate the mechanisms underlying anomalous RP responses. Laboratory and field trials validate the methodology’s efficacy in suppressing vibration interference during eddy current detection, demonstrating the probe’s reliability for surface defect detection in rail production.  - Previousarticle in issue - Nextarticle in issue",

    "abstract": "Conventional ultrasonic approaches for corrosion surveillance such as large-scale C-scans and continuous localised monitoring face inherent limitations in either temporal resolution or spatial coverage. Recent advances in sensor technology and low-cost autonomous robotics enables a hybrid approach that combine their strengths. However, critical questions remain about optimising such approaches, including determining the optimal inspection intervals, spatial coverage, and number of sensors. This study presents a multi-stage framework that addresses these challenges through integrated modelling: degradation simulation for spatiotemporal evolution of component surfaces, physics-based surrogate models for ultrasonic thickness measurements, data subsampling to replicate inspection and monitoring procedures, and reliability assessments against surveillance targets. Through Monte Carlo simulations on synthesised data calibrated to field measurements, we demonstrate the potential benefits of the hybrid strategy. Results show that strategic sensor placement and periodic repositioning can enhance reliability while reducing coverage requirements and extending inspection intervals. Importantly, this framework provides quantitative guidance for corrosion surveillance planning and can be adapted to different degradation phenomena across various asset types.  - Previousarticle in issue - Nextarticle in issue",

    "title": "Stratigraphic reconstruction from terahertz and ultrasonic signals by deconvolution: A review",
    "abstract": "Nondestructive evaluation techniques, such as terahertz and ultrasonic testing, use short pulses to probe layered materials and reconstruct their stratigraphy by analyzing time delays between echoes at internal interfaces. However, when layers are sufficiently thin, successive echoes temporally overlap, making direct identification of their number and timing challenging. In such cases, deconvolution techniques are employed to extract the impulse response or key features such as echo locations and amplitudes, improving resolution of the local stratigraphy. This review examines four widely used deconvolution algorithms for stratigraphic reconstruction under the assumption of a sparse impulse response, where layer boundaries are modeled as discrete, sharp echoes. Two time-domain methods—orthogonal matching pursuit and ℓ1-norm-based sparse deconvolution—and two frequency-domain approaches—multiple signal classification and autoregressive spectral extrapolation—are discussed. Their theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and comparative performance are evaluated using synthetic signals and experimental echograms from terahertz pulsed imaging and ultrasound sonography. These techniques enhance the ability to distinguish closely spaced interfaces and are applicable to defect detection in materials, tissue-layer analysis in medical diagnostics, and preprocessing for 3D imaging.  - Previousarticle in issue - Nextarticle in issue",

    "title": "Adaptive ultrasonic technique for inspection of complex geometry components with a matrix array",
    "abstract": "Ultrasonic phased-array technology is widely used in many NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) fields. Its ability to electronically steer and focus ultrasonic beams allows for comprehensive inspections with improved accuracy. However, the performances of an ultrasonic inspection may be degraded when the component being inspected exhibits an uneven surface. If the surface geometry is unknown, phased array technology is unable to correct the perturbations of acoustical beams using array settings. In this work, we present a new immersion adaptive inspection technique of large and complex-shaped components using a matrix array. In this approach, first, the unknown surface geometry of the inspected component is reconstructed from a series of 2D TFM images collected using only one row and one column of the matrix array acting as two independent orthogonal 1D arrays, in conjunction with mechanical 2D scanning. At this stage, the recorded 2D images are combined into a single wide-view 3D surface image by rotational SAFT algorithm, a simplified version of the standard SAFT method. The desired surface is extracted from the resulting image using an automatic global thresholding method. Then, based on the reconstructed surface and given the inspection probe trajectory, adapted focal laws to inspect the interior of the component are computed and applied at every location of the probe to correct the effect of the surface. The capabilities of the proposed inspection technique are illustrated by various simulated and experimental results carried out in a water tank. Its advantages and drawbacks will be discussed.  - Previousarticle in issue - Nextarticle in issue",

    "abstract": "Our work demonstrates an innovative AI-driven approach to Quality Assurance (QA) in metal additive manufacturing (AM). We focus on real-time defect detection in 3D metal printing, which is increasingly used to manufacture small parts for applications in safety-critical devices, including parts for the aerospace, automotive, and medical industries. We propose a model-based failure and defect detection system that combines visual monitoring and input from various sensors to control the AM process. By using a deep learning model and incorporating live monitoring of data points, we enable early anomaly detection and thus ensure immediate operator intervention to stop and prevent defective prints to be used in safety-critical applications. These techniques help prevent energy waste, conserve material costs, resources, time, and increase the safety and reliability of the system. Our prototype framework automates the classification of multiple defects, improving both the reliability of printed components and the efficiency of the manufacturing process by suggesting in-situ improvement techniques. We also highlight the technical challenges associated with data synchronisation and acquisition, as well as multiple sensor integration. Data collection is used not only for QA but also as valuable documentation for process validation and to maintaining an in-house learning center. Overall, our AI-driven approach improves the accuracy of non-destructive testing (NDT) over traditional post-production inspection methods. We propose a framework for the integration of AI to improve process control, making it more reliable for safety-critical industries and providing strong guidance for future model-based QA applications in AM processes. This framework can be applied for QA on TRUMPF TruPrint L-PBF 3D printing machines.",

    "abstract": "Carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are widely used in aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications due to their advantageous properties such as, high strength-to-weight ratio and fatigue resistance. However, their susceptibility to delamination presents a significant challenge, particularly under fatigue and mixed-mode loading conditions. Mode II delamination is a critical failure mode in CFRPs due to flexural loading conditions (bending), which is more complex than Mode I opening conditions. Mode II delamination mechanisms comprise of fiber imprints, cusps, and striations, making them challenging to detect, quantify and predict. This is especially relevant in low-velocity impact-induced damage in CFRP specimens, where delamination initiation and propagation are primarily influenced by flexural bending stresses. Therefore, being able to detect and predict crack growth is of great importance to ensure continued safety and reliability of CFRP components. Nondestructive testing (NDT), such as Ultrasonic Testing (UT), allows for the detection of such damage without exacerbating any damage, providing insights into the structural integrity of the component and providing real-time monitoring of the condition of the material. This dissertation develops an automated ultrasonic testing method to detect and quantify delaminations with high spatial and depth resolution in CFRP components, via the utilization of the full waveform (A-scan) analysis informed by user-defined thresholds, with results comparable to industry standard (X-ray CT) results. The average measurement difference between the two methods for the delaminated regions is 1.09%. Additionally, an automated UT depth analysis successfully located delaminations within one lamina interface. To improve fatigue life assessment, this study incorporates the UT-informed data of the initial crack front, to analytical models via beam theory, to correct theoretical crack length measurements, improving the validation of Mode II fatigue and quasi-static predictions thus better understanding crack growth behavior in CFRPs under flexural shear loading conditions. Finally, the study concludes with investigating the effects of symmetric and asymmetric cracks on fracture and fatigue behaviors in unidirectional CFRPs using the Virtual Crack Closure Technique-based finite element modeling. This study elucidates how delamination depth, thickness and initial crack length influences the effect of Mode I, Mode II and mode-mixity on crack propagation and fracture behavior in CFRPs.",

    "abstract": "Given the stringent accuracy requirements for spray gun calibration in thermal spraying applications, as well as practical and economic considerations, the typical point method [80] and direct measurement method [80] are commonly employed for spray gun calibration in applied contexts. The flowchart for the typical point method is shown in Fig. 13. In this approach, the industrial robot is maneuvered to adjust the position of the tool’s origin, bringing it into correspondence with a fixed reference point in the base coordinate system. The robot’s pose is recorded at the moment of this correspondence, and this process is repeated until the number of recorded poses exceeds the required minimum (usually no fewer than six points). Subsequently, mathematical algorithms, such as the least squares method, are utilized to optimize the transformation matrix between the tool’s coordinate system and the robot’s end effector. This transformation matrix is then configured in the robot control system to finalize the calibration. The direct measurement method relies on high-precision sensors to accurately measure the spatial position of the tool’s end. Common measurement instruments include laser trackers [80], coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) [80], and laser interferometers [80]. In this paper, Fig. 14 illustrates the calibration process utilizing a laser tracker. Initially, the laser measurement device is integrated with the robot control system, followed by the calibration of the measurement equipment to ensure precise tracking of the tool’s end position and orientation. The laser tracker then measures the tool’s end effector pose with high accuracy, gathering data from multiple measurement points. These results are input into the robot control system, which computes the position and orientation of the TCP. Finally, the robot control system completes the calibration process based on the computed results. To validate the calibration accuracy, the robot executes basic tasks, such as translation and rotation at multiple locations within the workspace, while the laser tracker continuously tracks the real-time positional changes of the tool’s end effector. This procedure ensures that the measured position of the tool’s end effector corresponds to the tool center point derived from the robot control system, thus confirming the precision and reliability of the calibration outcomes.",

Local variations in fibre orientation distribution, resin-rich zones, and inter-platelet interfaces influence damage initiation and growth under low-velocity impact (LVI), often leading to barely visible impact damage with irregular projected areas and non-uniform through-thickness morphology. This study applies Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Data Fusion via ultrasonic testing (UT), infrared thermography (IRT), and X-ray micro-computed tomography (CT) to post-impact PPMCs, using a pixel-level fusion framework to combine complementary information across modalities. Both feature integration and classification-based fusion (average, difference, maximum, and Hadamard product) are implemented to enhance damage contrast and improve projected area estimation. Morphological correlations are established by comparing CT reconstructions with micrographs and through layer-by-layer comparisons between UT C-scans and CT slices. Results show that multi-modal fusion reduces the limitations of single techniques, providing a more complete and reliable description of damage extent and morphology. These findings support the use of NDT data fusion for discontinuous long fibre composites and its inclusion in inspection protocols for aerospace and automotive applications.\nKeywords: Low-velocity impact, Long Discontinuous Fiber Composite, Damage, Non-Destructive Testing, Data Fusion\nSuggested Citation:\nDidone, Marco and Van Lear, Rachel and Jack, David and Kravchenko, S.
