    "title": "Radiofrequency Wave Sensing for Rapid Animal Health Monitoring: A Proof-of-Concept Study",
    "abstract": "Anemia caused by gastrointestinal parasitism is a major constraint to small ruminant productivity, particularly in low-resource production systems where diagnostic tools and veterinary access are limited. This study evaluated the potential of radiofrequency non distructive technique (RF-NDT) wave derived features as non-invasive biomarkers for anemia detection in goats, using FAMACHA© scores as a biological reference. Variable clustering of the top ten frequencies revealed distinct patterns across health states. Healthy animals (FAMACHA© 1) were characterized by a single frequency cluster centered at 8.43 GHz, explaining 93.7% of variation, whereas moderately affected animals (FAMACHA© 2) shifted to 9.33 GHz with reduced uniformity (88.7%). Borderline animals (FAMACHA© 3) required two clusters (9.89 and 8.23 GHz), explaining 91.0% of variation, indicating increasing tissue heterogeneity with anemia progression. Regression analysis demonstrated strong predictive power, with Linear Regression achieving R² = 1.00 and Random Forest R² = 0.79 (RMSE = 0.07), while Support Vector Regression underperformed (R² = 0.31). Classification models confirmed the feasibility of categorical anemia detection. The Multilayer Perceptron achieved the highest accuracy (0.84), F1-score (0.83), and ROC-AUC (0.94), outperforming Support Vector Machine (accuracy 0.67, F1 = 0.67) and K-Nearest Neighbors (accuracy 0.60, F1 = 0.61). These findings establish proof-of-concept that RF waves capture physiologically meaningful dielectric signatures linked to anemia, reflecting hemoglobin concentration, hydration, and microcirculatory function. The integration of RF sensing with machine learning offers a rapid, non-invasive, and scalable diagnostic approach for sustainable herd health management. Future work should expand validation across breeds and environments, optimize sensor design, and embed neural classifiers for field-ready deployment.",

Machine learning models, particularly a Multilayer Perceptron, accurately classified anemia based on these RF signatures (accuracy 0.84).

    "title": "Accurate Thickness Characterization of Glass Fiber-Reinforced Composites Using Terahertz Dispersion Compensation Method Based on Sparse Representation",
    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) technology, a new nondestructive testing (NDT) approach with frequencies generally ranging from 100 GHz to 10 THz, has been widely used by virtue of its excellent penetration and high spatial–temporal resolution for non-metallic materials. However, in the process of characterizing the thickness of glass fiber-reinforced composite (GFRP) laminate along the THz propagation direction, the dispersion effect of the material will severely affect the accuracy of thickness measurement. In this work, in order to reduce the influence of the dispersion effect and improve thickness estimation accuracy, a THz dispersion compensation method based on sparse representation is proposed to accurately estimate the sparse impulse vector from the dispersive THz signal, with thickness measurement accomplished by the dispersion compensation process. Finally, a series of numerical simulations and experiments were implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed THz dispersion compensation method in thickness measurement. It is worth noting that the minimum estimated error in thickness is only 0.11%.",

    "title": "Structural Safety Assessment of an Existing Steel Bridge After 55 Years of Service",
    "abstract": "In the 1960s, a unique and modern thin-walled steel superstructure was implemented for several road bridges in Poland. However, the structure has several structural and technological weaknesses that, over time, have led to severe structural damage (e.g., weld cracks, local buckling, etc.). The paper focuses on one of these bridges, which has been in service for over fifty years, where observed damages during detailed inspections necessitated a thorough experimental and numerical investigation to assess the structural safety of the superstructure. For this purpose, the new national guidelines for evaluating the safety of existing road bridges were utilised for the first time. The guidelines were based on the new Eurocode prEN 1990-2, which provides the basis for assessing existing structures. To enable reliable and rational maintenance decisions regarding repair or strengthening, a finite element analysis was conducted considering the condition survey, NDT, and material testing. Based on the experimental and numerical results within this new assessment framework, the final decision was made to close the bridge for service and replace the existing steel structure.",

The Tsallis and Masi entropies are information measures that can capture long-range interactions in various physical systems, while Shannon entropy is more appropriate for short-range correlations.

Specifically, we replace the Tsallis information measure with Masi's one, obtaining better results than the original methodology.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative analysis of a multi-modal non-destructive testing and evaluation program in evaluating the condition of concrete elements in two dam structures in Quebec, Canada. For each dam structure, one area, exhibiting varying degrees of deterioration, were meticulously investigated to evaluate the surface and subsurface integrity of the concrete. Visual surveys revealed surface-level defects, including cracks, spalling, and evidence of previous repairs. Subsurface conditions were evaluated through a multi modal non-destructive evaluation program. Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) was used for rapid screening of the area for potential delamination and voids, particularly in areas with prior repairs. Ultrasonic pulse echo (UPE) was utilized to verify the findings of the GPR scans, providing high-resolution data on internal defects within the top 500 mm. In addition, Impulse-Response (IR) testing was deployed to affirm presence of potential anomalies (voids and delamination) by identifying high-mobility zones. Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) was employed to evaluate mechanical properties, revealing variations in shear wave velocity, with lower velocities correlating to compromised material integrity. The main objective of the study was to study the effectiveness of these NDT-E methods in identifying sub-surface anomalies. The findings of this study revealed a good agreement between among between different assessment methods, enhancing confidence in defect detection and material characterization. While much of the concrete was found to be in satisfactory condition, several areas especially those with prior repairs exhibited notable surface and subsurface degradation. The findings emphasize the need for targeted maintenance and repair strategies to mitigate the identified defects and ensure the long-term safety and performance of the dams. This study showed the efficacy of combining multiple NDE techniques for detailed, non-invasive assessments of dam infrastructure.",

This architecture addresses an essential\nchallenge, underexplored in the literature: improving the resilience of\ndata-driven NDT platforms against traffic variability and improving\nsynchronization between the VTwin and its physical counterpart. Therefore, the\ncontributions of this article rely on NDT lifecycle by focusing on the\noperational phase, where telemetry modules are used to monitor incoming\ntraffic, and concept drift detection techniques guide retraining decisions\naimed at updating and redeploying the VTwin when necessary. We validate our\narchitecture with a network management use case, across various emulated\nnetwork topologies, and diverse traffic patterns to demonstrate its\neffectiveness in preserving acceptable performance and predicting per-flow\ndelay under unexpected traffic variation.

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic phased-array technology is widely used in many NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) fields. Its ability to electronically steer and focus ultrasonic beams allows for comprehensive inspections with improved accuracy. However, the performances of an ultrasonic inspection may be degraded when the component being inspected exhibits an uneven surface. If the surface geometry is unknown, phased array technology is unable to correct the perturbations of acoustical beams using array settings. In this work, we present a new immersion adaptive inspection technique of large and complex-shaped components using a matrix array. In this approach, first, the unknown surface geometry of the inspected component is reconstructed from a series of 2D TFM images collected using only one row and one column of the matrix array acting as two independent orthogonal 1D arrays, in conjunction with mechanical 2D scanning. At this stage, the recorded 2D images are combined into a single wide-view 3D surface image by rotational SAFT algorithm, a simplified version of the standard SAFT method. The desired surface is extracted from the resulting image using an automatic global thresholding method. Then, based on the reconstructed surface and given the inspection probe trajectory, adapted focal laws to inspect the interior of the component are computed and applied at every location of the probe to correct the effect of the surface.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBridge cables, which serve as critical load-bearing components in cable-supported bridges, are highly susceptible to broken wires caused by corrosion and fatigue. Accurate quantitative evaluation of this type of damage is essential to ensure structural safety. This study presents a novel quantitative evaluation method for identifying the number of broken wires by employing the magnetic flux leakage (MFL) signal in three-dimensional (3D) space. The method first acquires the 3D spatial magnetic leakage field and generates 3D arrays of MFL signals for computational analysis. It then extracts two categories of features. The first is the global feature, defined as the L1 norm distance (L1D) between the measured 3D spatial MFL signal and the defect-free reference signal. The second is the local feature, consisting of multi-scale waveform features organized as a feature array. The multi-scale waveform feature arrays are compressed using Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) to reduce computational redundancy. The compressed feature arrays are then introduced into the Elastic Net-Constrained Regression (ENCR) model to predict defect width. The number of broken wires is ultimately calculated as the ratio of the total L1D value to the L1D value corresponding to the predicted width of a single wire. For a given broken wire width, the L1D demonstrates linear superposition with respect to the number of broken wires, with goodness-of-fit values exceeding 0.999, enabling proportional quantification. Validation through simulations and experiments on PES7-127 cables (127 wires of 7 mm diameter) confirms the method's effectiveness. The simulations achieved 100 % accuracy in counting broken wires across varying widths and distributions, while experimental results verified 100 % quantification accuracy (within a tolerance of ±1 wire) for defects involving ≤4 broken wires. This performance is obtained using a training dataset of only 30 samples. This study provides a practical and efficient approach for bridge cable assessment.",

However, in the process of characterizing the thickness of glass fiber-reinforced composite (GFRP) laminate along the THz propagation direction, the dispersion effect of the material will severely affect the accuracy of thickness measurement. In this work, in order to reduce the influence of the dispersion effect and improve thickness estimation accuracy, a THz dispersion compensation method based on sparse representation is proposed to accurately estimate the sparse impulse vector from the dispersive THz signal, with thickness measurement accomplished by the dispersion compensation process. Finally, a series of numerical simulations and experiments were implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed THz dispersion compensation method in thickness measurement. It is worth noting that the minimum estimated error in thickness is only 0.11%.\nKeywords: composites; terahertz nondestructive testing; dispersion compensation; sparse representation; thickness measurement\n1. Introduction\nWith the advancement of technology and the rapid development of industry, the demand for new material is increasing exponentially. Compared with other materials, composites have been widely used in aerospace, the automotive industry, and petrochemical fields with great potentials due to their advantages of low density, high specific strength, high specific modulus, and good temperature resistance, e.g., in aerospace for manufacturing fuselage skins and engine blades, in the automotive industry for lightweight chassis components, and in petrochemical fields for corrosion-resistant pipelines and storage tanks [1]. However, composite materials are susceptible to manufacturing processes, the environment, and random factors, which may cause damage to the materials. In the manufacturing, assembly, and service stages in particular, damage will inevitably occur due to load, process deviations during manufacturing, ultraviolet radiation, and so on [2,3]. Such damage is often difficult to perceive visually, which greatly affects the bearing capacity of the structure and is a major hidden danger threatening the safety of the structure [4]. Therefore, it is necessary to use nondestructive testing (NDT) technology to detect damage inside composite materials [5].\nCurrent NDT techniques encompass ultrasound testing (UT) [6], X-ray computed tomography (CT) [7], infrared thermography (IRT) [8,9], and acoustic emission (AE) [10]. While practical, these methods exhibit inherent limitations. Ultrasonic detection (UT) utilizes the propagation and reflection characteristics of high-frequency sound waves in materials and analyzes material properties and structural changes by measuring the amplitude and time of flight of waveforms [11]. However, ultrasonic waves are easily scattered and lost in the medium, and the high attenuation and low signal-to-noise ratio of composite materials often limit the detection accuracy [12]. In addition, coupling media, such as water or gel, need to be used to connect the testing object, which increases the operational complexity and requires certain professional skills of the testing personnel. Based on the principle of ray attenuation, ray inspection uses X-rays or γ-rays to penetrate the material and analyzes the internal structure and defects of the material by comparing the intensity and image of the transmitted rays, but radiation poses health risks to operators [13]. In addition, since damage to materials leads to uneven heat transfer, infrared thermal imaging (IRT) uses an infrared camera to detect temperature differences on the surface of materials to identify defects. However, it cannot penetrate opaque materials and is easily affected by ambient temperature. Acoustic emission (AE) applies stress to the material and detects changes in the sound waves emitted by the material to identify damage. However, it needs to apply loading, cannot detect sleep defects, and is sensitive to noise, which limits its scope of application [8]. These limitations of the traditional detection methods make the phenomenon of non-detection and inaccurate detection often occur. Therefore, advanced NDT techniques are increasingly required for composite materials.\nTerahertz (THz) technology, a rising NDT method, has good penetration for many dielectric materials and non-polar materials, such as plastics [14], ceramics [15], composite materials [16], paper [17], and fabrics [18], due to its non-ionizing and non-radiative properties and high spatial–temporal resolution [19]. In the thickness measurement field in particular, many scholars have adopted THz NDT technology to accurately measure the thickness of materials. For example, Palka et al. [20] investigated the multilayer structure of ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) composites in the THz spectral range using time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) technology and measured the thickness of all layers by the transfer matrix method (TMM). Nsengiyumva et al. [21] applied the wavelet contraction denoising algorithm to remove signal noise, retaining the amplitude of the measured time-of-flight (TOF) signal, thereby accurately determining the thickness and location of each GFRP layering defect. Xu et al. [22] proposed a physically induced THz TOF compensation method, achieving precise measurement of damage thickness and high-resolution full-field damage imaging of GFRP composites. Beyond monolithic composite laminates, NDT of multi-material adhesive joints—such as glass–adhesive–steel structures widely used in automobile windows—has become an urgent industrial demand. Recent studies have explored hybrid techniques for such scenarios: high-frequency electromagnetic waves enable high-resolution detection of adhesive layer defects by leveraging dielectric property differences between materials [23], but suffer from limited penetration in high-loss adhesives. Phased array ultrasonic testing, on the other hand, effectively identifies interface delamination in adhesive joints [24], but requires coupling media, increasing operational complexity and limiting its application in in-line production. These challenges highlight the potential of THz technology in multi-material joint NDT: its non-ionizing nature and excellent penetration in dielectrics address the key limitations of existing methods.\nNevertheless, the reliability of the THz system results in practical applications is constrained by two primary factors: THz wave attenuation and dispersion effects [25]. These factors degrade echo intensity and induce waveform distortion at distant interfaces, particularly in thick specimens with multilayer structures, where backside echoes become noise-dominated [26]. Extensive efforts have been made to mitigate THz echo attenuation. For the dispersion effect of THz waves, studies indicate that dispersion is particularly pronounced in the THz band, especially in high-loss media, where it can cause signal distortion [27,28]. Additionally, dispersion effects are influenced by factors such as medium temperature, pressure, and microstructure, further complicating their behavior [29]. However, many studies have overlooked the dispersion effect, treating THz echoes merely as time-shifted and scaled versions of THz reference signals with no dispersion. In actual measurements, the thickness of a material is often determined by the time delay of two echoes [30]. The dispersion effect causes the THz echo signal to be elongated and distorted. For composite laminates with multilayer structures in particular, multiple wave packets stack together, further increasing the difficulty of wave packet separation and positioning, which will inevitably reduce THz time resolution.\nTherefore, in this work, a novel THz dispersion compensation method is proposed to accurately measure the thickness of a GFRP laminate based on sparse representation. The proposed method involves four core steps: establishing an improved dual Gaussian fusion (IDGF) model accounting for dispersion, constructing an overcomplete dictionary, solving the sparse impulse vector via a convex optimization algorithm, and calculating thickness using dispersion-compensated THz signals. Unlike traditional methods, the thickness of the sample to be measured is calculated from the compensated THz signal with no dispersion. In this case, the influence of the dispersion effect on measurement accuracy is eliminated. A series of numerical simulations and experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in thickness measurement of composite materials.\n2. Proposed Method\n2.1. Sparse Decomposition and Dispersion Compensation of THz Signal\n2.1.1. Physical Propagation Model of THz Signal\nIn the THz NDT of a GFRP, the THz response signal reflected from a sample can be regarded as the linear superposition of all reflected echo components from different interface reflectors in sample. Considering the interference of environmental noise, the THz response signal from a sample can be described as:\ny\n(\nt\n)\n=\n∑\ni\n=\n1\nn\nε\ni\nφ\ni\n(\nt\n)\n+\ne\n(\nt\n)\n(1)\nwhere\ny\n(\nt\n)\nrepresents the THz response signal,\nn\nrepresents the number of interface reflectors,\nε\ni\nrepresents the amplitude factor of the ith reflected echo,\nφ\ni\nrepresents the THz echo reflected from the ith reflector, and\ne\n(\nt\n)\nrepresents the environmental noise.\nFrom the perspective of the whole testing system, the reflected echo signal can be modeled as the convolution of the input THz reference signal and the response of the system, which can be described as:\ny\n(\nt\n)\n=\ni\n(\nt\n)\n⊗\nh\n(\nt\n)\n+\ne\n(\nt\n)\n(2)\nwhere\n⊗\nrepresents convolution operation,\ni\n(\nt\n)\nrepresents the THz reference signal reflected from a polished metal, and\nh\n(\nt\n)\nrepresents the response function of the system.\nNotably, the number of reflectors of the measured single-layer or multilayer sample is usually finite and the system response\nh\n(\nt\n)\nis usually sparse. That is to say, there are only a few non-zero pulse components in the sequence, and the other components are zero. Therefore, the impulse response function\nh\n(\nt\n)\ncan be defined as a series of Dirac functions with scaling and delay:\nh\n(\nt\n)\n=\n∑\nj\n=\n1\nJ\nρ\nj\nδ\n(\nt\n−\nτ\nj\n)\n(3)\nwhere\nρ\nj\nand\nτ\nj\nrepresent the weighting factor and time-delay factor associated with the ith reflector, respectively. δ(•) represents the Dirac function and\nJ\nis the number of spike pulses, which is consistent with the number of reflectors in sample.\nCombining Equations (2) and (3), the THz response signal can be expressed as:\ny\n(\nt\n)\n=\ni\n(\nt\n)\n⊗\n∑\nj\n=\n1\nJ\nρ\nj\nδ\n(\nt\n−\nτ\nj\n)\n+\ne\n(\nt\n)\n(4)\nThus, without considering the dispersion, the THz response signal can be composed of a series of THz reference signals with scaling and delay.\n2.1.2. Sparse Representation of THz Signals\nBased on the assumption of sparsity, the Equation (4) can be transformed into the matrix form as:\nY\n=\nI\nh\n+\ne\n(5)\nwhere\nI\n∈\nR\nN\n×\nK\nis an overcomplete dictionary constructed by translating THz reference signals, where\nI\nis\ni\n1\n(\nt\n)\n,\ni\n2\n(\nt\n)\n,\ni\n3\n(\nt\n)\n,\n…\n,\ni\nk\n(\nt\n)\n  (\nN\n≪\nK\n)\n.\nh\nis the sparse impulse vector, which contains finite non-zero values related to the number of reflectors. In order to maintain the sparsity of\nh\n, the number of atoms\nK\nin the overcomplete dictionary should be much larger than the dimensionality\nN\nof the dictionary.\nY\n∈\nR\nN\nand\ne\n∈\nR\nN\ndenote the vector of the THz response signal and Gaussian white noise. In this work, the dimensionality\nN\nof the overcomplete dictionary is set to 2048 and remains constant regardless of sample thickness. This value is determined by the fixed length of THz reference signals acquired by THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) system (2048 data points per signal), ensuring consistency between the dictionary dimension and signal dimension to avoid instability in a sparse solution due to dimensional variations.\nFrom Equation (5), solution problem of the sparse impulse vector\nh\ncan be simplified as a sparse representation (SR) problem in which SR can be defined as the product of an overcomplete dictionary containing a finite number of atoms and the sparse impulse vector [31]. Utilizing the SR method, the sparse impulse vector can be obtained and accurate thickness measurement can be performed. Figure 1 shows the principle of the SR method of the signal. As depicted in Figure 1a, the THz response signal can be expressed as a linear combination of multiple THz reference signal sequences (atoms). The weight parameters\nh\ni\nconstitute the corresponding sequence of sparse pulses, where\nh\n=\nh\n1\n,\nh\n2\n,\nh\n3\n,\n…\n,\nh\nk\nT\n. Figure 1b depicts the process of combining single atoms\nh\nk\nto form the overcomplete dictionary\nI\n. The colored rectangle in the sparse impulse vector represents different non-zero values, and the white rectangle in the sparse impulse vector represents zero elements. Assuming that there are five non-zero elements in the sparse pulse sequence\nh\n, its sparsity can be defined as 5, and the THz response signal\nY\ncan be linearly represented by the corresponding five atoms in the overcomplete dictionary (i.e., the red box in Figure 1b).\n2.1.3. THz Signal Model Considering Dispersion Effect\nDuring THz testing, the THz reference signal can be obtained from a polished metal plate, which can be represented by double Gaussian fusion (DGF) model as:\ni\n(\nt\n)\n=\nβ\n1\nexp\n−\nt\n−\nT\n1\n2\n/\nα\n1\n2\n+\nβ\n2\nexp\n−\nt\n−\nT\n2\n2\n/\nα\n2\n2\n(6)\nwhere\nβ\n1\nand\nβ\n2\nrepresent the amplitude of the Gaussian narrow pulse and Gaussian wide pulse, respectively;\nα\n1\nand\nα\n2\nrepresent the pulse width factor, which determines the duration of the pulse in the time domain; and\nT\n1\nand\nT\n2\nrepresent the initial positions of the two pulses in the time domain. In the experiment, the THz reference signal can be fitted by adjusting parameters\nβ\n1\n,\nβ\n2\n,\nα\n1\n,\nα\n2\n,\nT\n1\n,\nT\n2\n.\nHowever, when the THz wave propagates through the surface into the medium, the dispersion effect will lead to THz wave waveform broadening, amplitude attenuation, and phase distortion. With increments in the propagation distance of THz wave in the tested sample, the distortion and pulse broadening of the THz signal gradually increases, which renders the THz response signal more complex. In the DGF model, the duration of the pulse is determined by\nα\n1\nand\nα\n2\n. However, the traditional DGF model ignores the influence of propagation distance on dispersion and takes the dispersion parameter as a fixed value. In order to improve the accuracy of the model, the original DGF model can be improved.\nDue to the fact that the pulse width of THz wave increases with the propagation distance, this means that there is a positive correlation between the pulse width factor\nα\nand the initial position\nT\nof the pulse. Thus, the improved dual Gaussian fusion (IDGF) model can be represented as:\ni\n(\nt\n)\n=\nβ\n1\nexp\n−\nt\n−\nT\n1\n2\n/\nT\n1\nα\n1\n2\n+\nβ\n2\nexp\n−\nt\n−\nT\n2\n2\n/\nT\n2\nα\n2\n2\n(7)\nFor a specific THz reference signal, the time delay of the Gaussian narrow pulse and Gaussian wide pulse is constant:\nT\n1\n−\nT\n2\n=\nconstant\n. Therefore, the model parameters of IDGF are simplified to\nβ\n1\n,\nβ\n2\n,\nα\n1\n,\nα\n2\n,\nτ\n, where\nα\n1\n,\nα\n1\n, and\nτ\nare dispersion related parameters that can be adjusted to simulate dispersive THz signals.\nIn order to accurately characterize the THz reference signal, it is necessary to adjust the model parameters to closely match the THz signal generated by the IDGF model with the measured THz reference signal. Usually, parameter adjustment is conducted manually, which is time-consuming and imprecise, and the calculation process is cumbersome. In order to reduce the manual adjustment of parameters, the Gauss–Newton (GN) iteration algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the measured THz reference signal such that the THz reference signal fitted by the IDGF model can be aligned with the measured THz reference signal in experiments.\nInitially, the THz reference signal is obtained from the THz-TDS system with a sampling period of 0.004 ps. The length of the THz reference signal is 2048. Then, based on the proposed IDGF model, parameter estimation is performed with appropriate initial values, and the relevant estimated parameters are shown in Table 1. The simulated THz reference signal is shown in Figure 2. It can be clearly observed that the simulated THz reference signal from IDGF is the same as the measured THz reference signal from the experiment, which verifies the effectiveness of IDGF model.\n2.1.4. Dispersion Compensation Strategy\nIn the actual THz testing process of a GFRP, due to the frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion effects of THz signals in the tested material, THz signals are actually time-varying signals. In this case, the pulse broadening of the THz echo caused by the dispersion effect cannot be ignored, as it significantly reduces the accuracy of adjacent-wave-packet time-delay estimation based on time-invariant analysis, thereby affecting the accuracy of thickness measurement. Therefore, the propagation model of the THz signal in (5) can be modified by introducing a dispersion matrix:\nY\n=\nI\nD\nh\n+\ne\n=\nA\nh\n+\ne\n(8)\nwhere\nD\n∈\nR\nK\n×\nK\nis the dispersion matrix associated with the dispersion effect of THz waves in the material,\nA\nis the dispersion dictionary, and\nh\nis the sparse pulse vector that determines the amplitude and time delay of the THz signal.\nFrom (8), constructing an appropriate overcomplete dictionary\nA\nis vital to obtain the sparse impulse vector\nh\n. In this case, the parameter vectors\nα\n1\n,\nα\n1\nand\nτ\ncan be uniformly discretized within the selected parameter range using appropriate step sizes\n∆\nα\n1\n,\n  ∆\nα\n1\nand\n∆\nτ\nto construct the dispersion dictionary. The corresponding parameter numbers are\nN\nα\n1\n,\nN\nα\n2\n, and\nN\nτ\n, so the total number of atoms in\nA\nis\nK\n=\nN\nα\n1\n+\nN\nα\n2\n+\nN\nτ\n. It is worth noting that small step sizes will result in large dictionaries and extremely heavy calculations, while large step sizes will result in poor characterization of dispersion phenomena. As such, the step size can be adjusted to achieve a reasonable balance between computational efficiency and resolution.\nAfter constructing the overcomplete dictionary, as the sparse impulse response\nh\nhas only very few non-zero elements, the inverse problem in Equation (8) can be described as a sparse optimization problem with regularization constraints:\nh\n˜\n=\narg\nmin\nh\n  h\n0\n  s\n.\nt\n.\nY\n−\nA\nh\n2\n≤\nσ\n(9)\nwhere the L0-norm\nh\n0\nrepresents the number of non-zero elements in the sparse impulse response\nh\n,\ng\n2\nrepresents the L2-norm of the term, represents the regularization parameter related to the noise level, and\nh\n˜\nrepresents the optimal sparse impulse response to be solved. Furthermore, Equation (9) can be expressed as an L0-norm optimization problem:\nh\n˜\n=\narg\nmin\nh\n  Y\n−\nA\nh\n2\n+\nγ\nh\n0\n(10)\nwhere\nγ\nrepresents the regularization parameter that balances the L2-norm term (loss term) and L1-norm term (sparsity term). When\nγ\nis small, the weight of the loss term is relatively high, which is beneficial for the reconstructed signal in terms of closely matching the original signal, but it can lead to poor sparsity. On the contrary, when\nγ\nis large, sparse terms match larger weights, enhancing the sparsity of the reconstructed signal, but resulting in poor fitting of the signal. Therefore, it is essential to select an appropriate regularization parameter\nγ\n[32].\nHowever, due to the non-convexity of the L0 regularization optimization problem, even after difficult combinatorial searches, it cannot be guaranteed that the obtained results are globally optimal. The sparse optimization problem in Equation (10) is a typical NP-hard problem [33]. Therefore, it is necessary to relax the L0-norm to the L1-norm and transform the non-convex optimization problem into a convex optimization problem.\nh\n˜\n=\narg\nmin\nh\n  Y\n−\nA\nh\n2\n+\nγ\nh\n1\n(11)\nAfter such a transformation, Equation (11) can be solved through convex optimization algorithms, such as the spectral projection gradient (SPG) algorithm [34]. In this case, the estimated sparse impulse vector can be obtained and the reconstructed THz response signal\nY\n˜\ncan be represented as:\nY\n˜\n=\nA\nh\n˜\n(12)\nDue to the fact that overcomplete dictionary\nA\nconsists of a series of time-shifted THz reference signals, compensated THz signals can be obtained by convolving the time-shifted THz reference signals with sparse pulse response. Thus, the dispersion compensation process can be performed using Equation (5):\nY\n^\n=\nI\nh\n˜\n(13)\nwhere\nY\n^\nrepresents the compensated THz signal and\nI\nis an overcomplete non-dispersion dictionary.\n2.2. Thickness Measurement Based on Compensated THz Signal\nAt present, the key for thickness measurement based on THz technology is to accurately determine the time of flight (TOF) between two adjacent wave packets of the THz signal. In the case of vertical incidence of the THz wave, the thickness\nd\nof the GFRP to be measured is defined as:\nd\n=\nc\nΔ\nt\n2\nn\n=\nc\nt\nsec\nond\n−\nt\nfirst\n2\nn\n(14)\nwhere\nc\nis the speed of light.\nΔ\nt\nis the time-delay difference of two adjacent wave packets.\nt\nfirst\nand\nt\nsec\nond\nare the corresponding time delay of the first and second wave packets of the THz signal, respectively.\nn\nis the refractive index of the sample.\nBased on Equation (14), the measured TOF is crucial for accurately determining the thickness of the GFRP laminate. Figure 3 shows the measured THz dispersion signal from a single-layer GFRP laminate. It can be seen that the THz wave is prone to dispersion during propagation, which will lead to the broadening and overlapping of each echo component in the THz signal. In this case, accurately measuring the thickness of the sample to be tested from a complex dispersive THz signal has become a major challenge.\nIn this work, a new thickness measurement method is proposed based on the characteristics of the compensated THz signal. Theoretically, for the GFRP sample to be measured, the propagation time of the THz wave through the sample can be obtained by the time-delay\nΔ\nt\ndifference between the first pulse and the last pulse of the THz signal. Due to the dispersion effect, the pulse wave packet expands, which degrades the estimation accuracy of TOF. In this case, the dispersion effect can be eliminated by dispersion compensation, and a compensated THz signal with no dispersion can be reconstructed. Therefore, accurate thickness measurement can be performed based on the TOF estimated from the compensated THz signal.\n3. Results and Discussion\nA series of numerical simulations and experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Firstly, dispersion compensation was carried out for the simulated THz signals based on the IDFG model. Then, experiments were performed on a GFRP laminate sample to estimate its thickness based on the compensated THz signal.\n3.1. Numerical Simulation\nInitially, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of THz signals from GFRP samples with different thicknesses were simulated based on the IDFG model: 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.8 mm, and 1.0 mm. During this process, the refractive index of the GFRP was set to 1.95 [35]. In this case, according to the thickness and refractive index, the time-delay difference for different GFRP samples was obtained by Equation (14). Thus, the dispersive THz signals corresponding to the thicknesses can be obtained by adjusting the amplitude and dispersion factors in the IDFG model. Then, dispersion compensation was carried out on the simulated THz signals, and the compensated THz signals with no dispersion were obtained. Finally, the thickness of different samples was calculated based on the compensated THz signal.\n3.1.1. THz Dispersion Compensation Results\nTo better show the simulated dispersive THz signal, Figure 4a–c show the simulated THz signals of GFRP samples with thicknesses of 200 μm, 600 μm and 1000 μm, respectively. The corresponding IDFG model parameters are shown in Table 2. It can be clearly observed that the THz signals have undergone the dispersion effect at the second wave packet, resulting in a significant pulse broadening. In particular, when the thickness of the sample to be tested is relatively small, the two THz echo components overlap, as shown in Figure 4a, which makes accurate thickness estimation challenging. In addition, as the thickness of GFRP samples increases, the reflected THz echoes from the upper and lower interfaces of samples gradually separate. However, the amplitude of the echo component from the lower reflected interface gradually decreases due to the attenuation effect, as shown in Figure 4a–c.\nFigure 4d–f show the dispersion compensation results for different THz signals. It can be found that the compensated THz signals using the proposed dispersion compensation method can eliminate the dispersion effect. In this case, each recovered echo component can be regarded as a scaled and time-shifted THz reference signal with no dispersion. At the same time, each wave packet after compensation contains sharp pulse components, which is beneficial for obtaining accurate TOF information for the thickness estimation. Moreover, the reconstructed THz echoes are consistent with the theoretical THz echoes without any dispersion, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed dispersion compensation method.\n3.1.2. Thickness Estimation Results\nAfter completing the dispersion compensation process, the time-delay difference between the two echo components in the compensated THz signal can be easily obtained. The estimated thickness for different THz signals is calculated by Equation (14). Figure 5 displays the thickness estimation results of GFRP samples with different thicknesses using the proposed method. It is clear that the estimated thicknesses are very close to the true thickness values for all samples with different thicknesses from 100 μm to 1000 μm, and the corresponding estimation error is below 1% for all. Even for the worst case, i.e., the GFRP sample with a thickness of 600 μm, the estimated thickness is 594.6 μm, resulting in a maximum error of 0.90%, which indicates that the proposed thickness estimation method based on the compensated THz signal can achieve superior performance. Specially, when the thickness of a sample is small, the THz signal is overlapping. In this case, the estimation error is also only 0.39% for the overlapping THz signal from the sample with 100 um thickness. When the thickness of samples gradually increases, the amplitudes of THz signals gradually decrease and the pulsed widths gradually increase due to dispersion effects. For example, when the damage thicknesses are 800 μm and 1000 μm, the estimation error from the proposed method is 0.11% and 0.31%, respectively. Overall, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed thickness measurement method over a wide range of thicknesses in THz NDT.\n3.2. Experimental Validation\nA series of experiments were implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Initially, the GFRP laminate samples with various thicknesses were prepared by a commercial 3D printer. The transverse dimensions of the laminate samples were 100 mm × 100 mm, and the thicknesses were set to 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.8 mm and 1.0 mm. During this experiment, the THZ-TDS system was used to collect the THz signals of the sample, and the effective frequency range of the system was 10 GHz–4.5 THz. To achieve better depth resolution, the reflection mode was adopted. Figure 6 shows the THz-TDS system used, consisting of a femtosecond laser, an optical delay line, a control unit, a THz transmitter and receiver, and an x–y motion platform. Femtosecond lasers were used to generate THz pulses. The THz transmitter and receiver were responsible for transmitting and receiving THz signals and were installed on the x–y motion platform. The x–y motion platform was used for raster scanning to collect all THz signals of samples by setting an appropriate scanning step. Specifically, during the operation of THz-TDS, the femtosecond laser first generates a pump pulse and a detection pulse through a beam splitter. The pump pulse stimulates the photoconductive antenna to generate a THz pulse. The detection pulse, a coherent pulse, is used to detect the reflected THz signal in the receiver. In addition, an optical delay line is used to adjust the time delay of THz signal.\nIn the actual THz testing process, the distance between the THz transmitter and the polished metal plate first is adjusted (focus process), with the transmitter emitting a THz wave, which is reflected by the metal plate, and then the THz reference signal can be collected by the receiver. Then, the prepared GFRP sample to be tested is placed horizontally on the metal plate, with the distance between the THz transmitter and the tested sample readjusted (refocus process) and the THz wave emitted again, and the THz signal from the tested sample can be obtained in the receiver. Finally, the THz signals of all sampling points of the sample are collected by moving the x–y scanning platform with an appropriate step size. For this experiment, the measurement was conducted in a dry environment with a temperature of 23 °C to 25 °C and humidity of 32% to 34%. The sampling period was set to 0.02 ps, the signal length was set to 2048, and the scanning step was set to 0.2 mm.\n3.2.1. THz Dispersion Compensation Results\nThen, the proposed method was applied to perform the dispersion compensation on the dispersive THz signals collected in the experiment. Figure 7 shows the dispersion compensation results for the GFRP laminate samples with different thicknesses, including 200 μm, 600 μm, and 1000 μm, respectively. In Figure 7a–c, it can be clearly observed that as the sample thickness increases, the pulse amplitude of the second wave packet gradually decreases, and the pulse width gradually increases due to the dispersion effects. Notably, the THz signal contains additional echo components except for the two main pulses, due to the multiple reflections of the THz wave between the two interfaces of the sample, which increases the complexity of the THz signal. In addition, the THz signal is affected by the noise, which increases the difficulty of accurate thickness measurement. Figure 7d–f show the dispersion compensation results. It can be seen that the compensated signal has only two clean wave packets, and the pulse fluctuation in the original dispersive THz signal can be eliminated. Also, the dispersion in the THz signal can be suppressed well. In this case, the echo components from the upper and lower interfaces of the GFRP laminate sample can be identified well, which improves the thickness estimation accuracy. Therefore, the compensated results for the dispersive THz signal verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n3.2.2. Estimated Thickness Results\nFurthermore, the GFRP laminate thickness are calculated according to the time delay of two pulse peaks of the compensated THz signal. For this work, the proposed method is applicable to GFRP laminates with a maximum thickness of approximately 1.0 mm. Due to the fact that we estimate sample thickness by compensating for the pulse time delay of the signal, the dispersion compensation result directly determines the accuracy of thickness estimation. The calculated thickness results for different samples are shown in Figure 8. It can be clearly observed that the estimated thickness values for different samples agree very well with the true values. In addition, the estimation error decreases as the thickness increases. In particular, when the sample thickness is 200 μm, the thickness estimation performance is the worst, but the estimation error is still below 7%. At this time, the estimated thickness of the GFRP laminate is 213.59 μm, and the corresponding error is only 6.79%. In addition, when the GFRP thickness is 1000 μm, the estimation error reaches the lowest value of 0.12%, which indicates the superior thickness estimation performance of the proposed method. Therefore, these experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed dispersion compensation method for thickness estimation with variable thicknesses in THz NDT.\n4. Conclusions\nThis work focused on the thickness measurement of GFRP laminates and proposes a THz dispersion compensation method based on sparse representation. The core of the proposed method is to estimate the sample thickness using the time delay of the two pulse peaks of the compensated THz signal. Firstly, the physical propagation model of the THz signal is established based on the transmission characteristics of the THz wave. Subsequently, in order to characterize the dispersion effect of the THz wave, the IDGF model considering the dispersion effect is established. Furthermore, the SR model is proposed to establish the relationship between the dispersive THz signal and sparse impulse vector, and the dispersion compensation process can be performed to suppress the effect of dispersion. Finally, accurate thickness estimation can be achieved by the compensated THz signal. In simulations, relative measurement errors were all below 1%. In experiments, relative errors were within 7%, which implies the method effectively eliminates dispersion-induced errors. The simulation and experimental results indicate the superior performance of the proposed dispersion compensation method for accurate thickness measurement, and provide a novel insight for THz NDT in high-precision measurement scenarios.\nThe proposed method has potential applicability to other non-metallic dielectric materials (e.g., plastics, ceramics, paper), as its core mechanism—dispersion compensation via sparse representation—targets the universal dispersion phenomenon of THz waves in dielectric materials independently of material type. Future work will validate the method on more materials, with a focus on high-loss materials, which may require additional denoising algorithms to enhance stability.\nAuthor Contributions\nMethodology, Y.X. and P.L.; formal analysis, X.P. and H.Z.; investigation, Y.X., P.L. and H.Z.; writing—original draft, Y.X.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the widespread application of precast construction (PC), effectively detecting internal defects in concrete components is crucial for structural safety and durability. This study proposes a novel multi-stage phased array ultrasonic imaging method based on adaptive amplitude-phase fusion (AAPF) to enhance the accuracy and reliability of defect detection. First, multi-scale phase congruency (MPC) captures coherent features in the spatial frequency domain. Second, adaptive phase-entropy weighting (APW) suppresses random noise using the entropy of local instantaneous phase distributions. Third, phase-amplitude interaction (PAI) enhances imaging stability through a nonlinear fusion strategy. Integrating these strategies with total focusing method (TFM) significantly improves imaging clarity and robustness. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves an average increase of 9.43 dB in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 26.06 % in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) compared to traditional TFM. Additionally, it effectively suppresses background noise without reducing target signals, surpassing the conventional Circular Coherence Factor (CCF) method. Full-scale experiments further demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting internal defects within PC concrete components in complex reinforced environments, providing a novel and effective solution for non-destructive testing in precast construction.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a gain flatness-enhanced, wideband pulse amplifier for ultrasonic instrumentation is presented. The power supply and a detection-and-signal-conditioning circuit were designed for the gain flatness enhancement and the control algorithm of the power supply was modified accordingly. To investigate the effects of the gain flatness enhancement, comparative measurements were performed on three conditions: without correction, with the conventional correction method, and with the correction method proposed in this study. Without correction, the pulse amplifier gain dropped by 1.1 dB across the 312.5 kHz to 20 MHz range under a 50-Ω load. Traditional methods reduced this to 0.3 dB, whereas the developed method achieved a reduction to 0 dB. Similarly, under a 470-pF load, the drop was 3.8 dB without compensation, 0.7 dB with conventional methods, and only 0.09 dB using the developed technique. This work also aims to increase penetration depth by boosting output amplitude. To improve the output voltage level, discrete circuit components were used instead of voltage-limited integrated circuit (IC)-based metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). This enabled a 150% increase in output voltage, from 200 to 500 Vpp. Consequently, the proposed gain-flatness-enhanced high-voltage and wideband pulse amplifier is expected to improve measurement accuracy in advanced ultrasonic systems, particularly in applications such as non-destructive testing (NDT), Doppler imaging, and material characterization.",

    "title": "Manufacture, process simulation, modelling and testing of thick-walled thermoset fibre-polymer composite laminates — A review☆",
    "abstract": "Abstract\nThick-walled thermoset fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites present unique challenges across their manufacturing, simulation, modelling, and testing processes. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current challenges and research needs associated with thick-walled FRP, particularly in light of their growing relevance in demanding application domains, such as wind energy. It is important to emphasise that the designation of a laminate as thick-walled is determined not solely by its nominal thickness, but also by the direction of the applied load. In particular, laminates subjected to compressive loading are typically considered thick-walled from a wall thickness of 4 mm or greater. While conventional manufacturing techniques remain applicable to thick-walled FRPs, process adaptations, such as adjusted curing cycles or alternative curing methods, are necessary to mitigate manufacturing defects, e.g. residual stresses induced by inhomogeneous curing due to local temperature overshoot. Modelling of the curing process and accurate prediction of residual stress development remain key areas of ongoing research with significant gaps in understanding. The influence of the wall thickness can also be seen in quasi-static and impact tests. Self-heating must be taken into account in fatigue tests and must be incorporated into future guidelines for the design of thick-walled FRP structures. While well-established non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques are generally applicable, their effectiveness is reduced with increasing laminate thickness due to limitations in resolution. The findings underscore the need for continued interdisciplinary efforts to refine processing and evaluation methods for thick-walled FRP composites.",

    "title": "Probabilistic detection assessment based on one-dimensional signal distribution in eddy current testing under low signal-to-noise ratio",
    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study proposes a novel approach for evaluating the probability of detection (POD) by considering the spatial distribution characteristics of measured signals, with a particular focus on its application in eddy current testing (ECT) under a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situation. To simulate such a situation, eighteen welded austenitic stainless-steel plates were prepared, and seventy-three artificial slits were introduced parallel to their weld beads to simulate weld cracks. ECT signals were collected from the samples using a uniform eddy current probe. Experimental results revealed that evaluating flaw presence solely based on the maximum amplitude of measured signals, as employed in the conventional â-a approach, was quite misleading. In contrast, the proposed approach, which quantifies deviations in the one-dimensional spatial distributions of signals inspired by the Gini coefficient used in economics to assess income inequality, provided fewer false positives and false negatives. A multi-parameter POD model was then developed, formulating POD as a function of both the length and depth of a slit using these deviations, namely the Gini values. Decision thresholds, which are critical for POD estimation, were determined from the maximum signal features of the seven slit-free samples. The results demonstrate that the proposed Gini-based approach enables a simpler POD analysis while reducing false detections and mitigating the challenge of setting a proper decision threshold under a low SNR situation, in contrast to the conventional amplitude-based method.",

    "abstract": "Imam, Muhafid (2025) ANALISA KERUSAKAN PISTON CROWN TERHADAP KINERJA MAIN ENGINE DI KAPAL VICTORIA LYRA. SKRIPSI.\nText\nIMAM MUHAFID FIX CD.pdf\nRestricted to Repository staff only\nDownload (2MB)\nAbstract\nThe main engine is a vital component of ship propulsion that must be properly maintained to ensure optimal performance. This study analyzes crown damage on the main engine of the VICTORIA LYRA vessel, which led to engine failure during a voyage. Causes of the damage include poor lubrication, the use of secondhand spare parts, as well as lack of coordination and accuracy from the engineering crew. The research employs a case study method and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) to identify the damage. The results show that crown damage has a significant impact on engine performance. This study is expected to serve as a reference for comprehensive engine maintenance. Analysis is the process of detailed observation to understand damage, such as that occurring on diesel engine s. The crown plays a crucial role in the combustion process. damage leads to decreased main engine performance. Contributing factors include wear, dirty injectors, damaged turbochargers, or low- quality fuel. The inspection involves measuring the and liner diameters and comparing them to standard values. Indications of damage include black smoke, difficulty starting the engine, and decreased RPM. This research uses a qualitative approach with a cross-sectional survey method. Data were collected through direct observation during the author's service aboard the VICTORIA LYRA vessel and through literature studies. The focus of the research is noise originating from the crown of the ship's main engine during operation. Data sources include primary data (observations and interviews on board) and secondary data (books, journals, and online references). Data collection techniques include field studies, observations, and literature reviews. Research tools include cameras and measuring instruments such as vernier calipers and dial indicators. The findings from the VICTORIA LYRA vessel show that crown damage was caused by clogged lubrication, worn cylinder liners, and components exceeding their service life. The impacts include reduced engine performance, overheating, and sudden engine stoppage. The mitigation efforts involve inspecting and testing the quality of lubricating oil and conducting maintenance or replacement of cylinder liners according to technical procedures. This study provides valuable insight into preventing engine damage and maintaining ship engine performance.
