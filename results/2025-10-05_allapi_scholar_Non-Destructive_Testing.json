    "abstract": "Heavy-density concrete plays a pivotal role in providing structural integrity and radiation shielding in critical infrastructure. However, exposure to acidic environments poses a significant challenge, potentially compromising the material's durability and mechanical properties. This research examines the mechanical and non-destructive properties of heavy-density concrete produced by integrating grit iron scale aggregates as coarse aggregate in concrete and the utilization of silica fume as a supplementary cementitious material. The experiments involve preparing samples using 25% and 50% Heavy Weight Grit Iron Scale (HWGS) Aggregate along with 15% silica fume. Concrete specimens were tested for slump, compressive strength and rebound hammer after 28 days of curing. The water-cured specimens were exposed to 10% of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The findings indicated that concrete containing 25% HWGS exhibited superior acid resistance in comparison to the other concrete mixes while achieving maximum compressive strength.",

    "title": "Guided wave localization and quantification of actual corrosion damage in metallic pipelines considering environmental factors",
    "abstract": "Abstract Corrosion damage is a primary cause of pipeline failure, and guided waves are conventionally employed for non-destructive testing purposes. However, the intricacy of authentic corrosion damage and environmental factors (EFs) complicate the quantitative evaluation of corrosion damage by guided waves. In this paper, four metal pipes with different degrees of corrosion were prepared by accelerated corrosion experiments over a period of 30 days, and a guided wave localization method for pipeline corrosion damage considering EFs and a corrosion degree quantification method based on the change of guided wave velocity are proposed. These methods utilize the interaction between the propagation characteristics of guided waves and corrosion damage, while taking into account the interference caused by EFs, and reduce the influence of EFs on the localization and quantitative assessment of corrosion damage by extracting features that are sensitive to corrosion damage. The experimental findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in achieving precise corrosion damage location and quantitative assessment of the degree of corrosion. The relative errors in corrosion damage location and quantitative assessment were found to be 6.28% and 9.38%, respectively. The methods provided in this paper offer new solutions for the detection of corrosion damage in metallic pipelines in real engineering.",

    "title": "Research on the Hyperspectral-based Unmixing Model of Composite Pigments on Mural Surfaces",
    "abstract": "Abstract. Murals constitute an invaluable component of cultural heritage, encapsulating profound artistic and historical significance. Hyperspectral remote sensing, as a non-destructive testing technique, offers an effective means for analysing and identifying mural pigments. We proposed a spectral unmixing method based on the negative logarithm of spectral reflectance, aimed at improving the accuracy of quantitative analysis for composite pigments in murals. We obtained three sets of mixed spectra: cinnabar-orpiment, azurite-orpiment, and azurite-malachite. The original reflectance was converted into negative logarithmic values, and linear models were applied for unmixing. Supervised unmixing was conducted in the experiment to evaluate the model’s precision, with the unmixing process carried out using known endmembers. The unmixing accuracy was quantified using the Root Mean Square Error, which compares the estimated abundances of all endmembers with actual values. Additionally, a comparison was made between the negative logarithmic transformation and the commonly used transformations of original reflectance, first derivative, and second derivative. The result show that the logarithmic hyperspace linear model simplifies spectral unmixing complexity, enhancing the accuracy of linear unmixing models in addressing mixed pigment unmixing problems. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for real murals, the improved model was applied to the hyperspectral data unmixing analysis of murals collected by the Yungang Academy, located in Shanxi Province, China. Experimental findings demonstrate that, compared to traditional methods, the improved unmixing approach more precisely represents the pigment distribution in the murals. This study offers new ideas and methods for the digital preservation and restoration of mural composite pigments.",

The MBR was fabricated using the soften-and-compress technique on standard SMF-28 silica fibre, creating a bottle-shaped structure with controlled bottle diameter, stem diameter, and bottle length. A tapered microfiber with a 2 µm waist diameter was used for coupling, enabling the resonator to achieve a high quality factor (Q &gt; 1.5×10⁵), confirming its low-loss performance and strong field confinement. Honey samples with concentrations ranging from 10% to 60% were analysed. The MBR sensor demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.0824 dB/% with excellent linearity of 97%, while wavelength-shift analysis showed an additional sensitivity of 4.0 pm/%. The sensor exhibited stable and repeatable responses across multiple experimental cycles and short-term stability tests. Compared with conventional techniques such as refractometry, FTIR, and electrochemical methods, the MBR offers significant advantages in compactness, non-destructive measurement, and sensitivity.

    "abstract": "Abstract Internal defects such as bubbles and delamination in 3D-printed carbon fiber composite components severely compromise the mechanical properties of these components. Infrared thermography is an effective technique for detecting internal defects in materials. However, traditional detection methods depend on manual inspection, which suffers from several limitations, including low efficiency, relatively high false detection rates, and slow processing speed. These shortcomings hinder their ability to meet the demands of industrial applications. This study proposes an model of Infrared Non-destructive Testing - You Only Look Once V11(INDT-YOLOV11 )rapid object detection model. Based on YOLOV11n, we present a VSP-C3k2 module incorporating variant spatial pooling to mitigate noise interference during feature fusion. The SaE mechanism from SENetV2 is integrated with the C2PSA module to form a SaE-C2PSA attention mechanism, enhancing defect feature representation. To improve detection speed, the original backbone network in YOLOV11n is replaced with a MobileNetV2 feature extraction network. A dataset containing bubbles and delamination defects was established using Infrared Non-destructive Testing(INDT) based on halogen lamp to capture infrared thermal images. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with YOLOV11n, the proposed INDT-YOLOV11 model achieves 20.85% and 20.75% improvements in mAP50 and mAP50-90 metrics respectively, while reducing parameter count and computational load by approximately 38.59% and 39.06%. On GTX1050 hardware, INDT-YOLOV11 achieves 31.5 FPS with 23.05% speed enhancement. And INDT-YOLOV11 has achieved almost the same mAP50 as YOLOV8-worldv2 and YOLOX lightweight models with minimal parameter and computational complexity, making it highly competitive in models such as YOLO-SA，providing effective technical support for automated internal defect detection in 3D-printed carbon fiber composite components.",

Subsequently, the stress and displacement distribution characteristics of the anchor head were analysed by numerical simulation. Two ultrasonic sensors (2.5 MHz and 5.0 MHz) were employed to test the prestress of the anchor, and a relationship between the energy and prestress was established. The results showed that the prestress can be determined by analysing the reflection waves, the energy of which decreased nonlinearly with increasing load, and the energy – prestress relationship could be well fitted using an exponential function. The 2.5 MHz ultrasonic sensor outperformed the 5.0 MHz ultrasonic sensor, and the third reflection wave (RW3) exhibited the highest stability and best fitting, making it suitable for establishing the relationship between the energy and prestress of the ground anchor.

A periodic pinhole array mask is placed between the X-ray source and the sample to spatially modulate the X-ray beam, dividing it into multiple independent sub-beams. Each sub-beam is deflected due to the modulation effect of the sample, resulting in slight positional shifts in the intensity patterns formed on the detector. The experiments employ an X-ray source with a 400 μm focal spot and use a two-dimensional step-scanning approach to acquire image sequences of various samples. The experimental results show that this method can extract the edge profile and structural changes in the samples to some extent, and it demonstrates good contrast and detail recovery under weak absorption conditions.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The quality parameters of quail eggshells find extensive utility in studies of production efficiency and basic biology. Non‐destructive evaluation methods are of particular relevance. Herein, we developed a non‐destructive technology for assaying such shell characteristics as shell strength ( F ), thickness ( T ), and weight ( W s ). Studies were conducted using 176 eggs laid by 11‐month‐old quails from a resource population of F 2 crossbreds. The main set of measured and calculated parameters included egg weight ( W ), volume ( V ), and surface area ( S ). In addition, we determined an indicator of elastic shell deformation under a non‐destructive load of 0.5 kg ( δ 0.5 ). Use of this parameter set allowed us to make the most accurate non‐invasive prediction of the values of F ( R = 0.756), T ( R = 0.266), and W s ( R = 0.450) for quail eggs. As a result of comparative analysis of the current and previously obtained equations for calculating W s , the disadvantages of using empirical equations were also identified. Herewith, we proposed the so‐called index approach to forming mathematical dependences, simplifying their further use, for example, in breeding studies. As such, we selected the following conditionally called indices: metabolism index ( S / V ) and specific elastic shell deformation ( δ 0.5 / W ). Following the approximation, more convenient and compact dependences were produced. The correlation coefficients between the true and computed values were 0.749 for predicting F , 0.262 for T , and 0.443 for W s , with corresponding RMSE values equal to 0.416 for F , 0.019 for T , and 0.105 for W s . The established index representation of empirical equations will serve as a crucial instrument for eggshell quality control and application in quail breeding.",

    "abstract": "The axle is an important part of the EMU. If the axle is damaged, it will greatly harm the driving safety, so it is necessary to find out the defects and hidden dangers of the axle in time. At present, the main non-destructive detection methods for the inner wall damage of hollow axle are ultrasonic detection, but this method has the problem of low detection accuracy for the inner wall near the surface of the axle. In order to solve this problem, a cylindrical array eddy current testing method is proposed in this paper. Compared with ultrasonic wave, eddy current generated by alternating electromagnetic field has stronger penetration, so the electromagnetic detection method can solve such problems well. Through modeling and simulation of the damage detection method on the inner wall surface, the detection signal results under different hidden defects are analyzed, and the defects are preliminarily determined. The results show that compared with the traditional ultrasonic detection method, the detection accuracy of this eddy current detection method can be increased to 0.25mm and provide a basis for the follow-up experiment to explore the relationship between the defect characteristics and the signal change law, the hidden defects of the inner wall can be preliminarily estimated in the future.",

    "summary": "Axle damage in EMUs presents a serious safety risk, but current ultrasonic detection methods for inner wall defects in hollow axles have limited accuracy, especially near the surface. To overcome this, this paper proposes a cylindrical array eddy current testing method, which utilizes the stronger penetration of eddy currents. Through modeling and simulation, this method demonstrated a significantly improved detection accuracy of 0.25mm. This advancement offers a more precise way to identify hidden inner wall defects compared to traditional ultrasonic techniques."

    "title": "PathQC: Determining Molecular and Physical Integrity of Tissues from Histopathological Slides",
    "abstract": "Quantifying tissue molecular and physical integrity is essential for biobank development. However, current assessment methods either involve destructive testing that depletes valuable biospecimens or rely on manual evaluations, which are not scalable and lead to interindividual variation. To overcome these challenges, we present PathQC, a deep learning framework that directly predicts the tissue RNA Integrity Number (RIN) and the extent of autolysis from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole-slide images of normal tissue biopsies. PathQC first extracts morphological features from the slide using a recently developed digital pathology foundation model (UNI), followed by a supervised model that learns to predict RNA Integrity Number and autolysis scores from these morphological features. PathQC is trained on and applied to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) cohort, which comprises 25,306 non-diseased post-mortem samples across 29 tissues from 970 donors, where paired ground truth RIN and autolysis scores were available. Here, PathQC predicted RIN with an average correlation of 0.47 and an autolysis score of 0.45, with notably high performance in Adrenal Gland tissue (R=0.82) for RIN and in Colon tissue (R=0.83) for autolysis. We provide a pan-tissue model for the prediction of RIN and autolysis score for a new slide from any tissue type. Overall, PathQC will enable scalable measurement of molecular and physical integrity from routine H&amp;E images, thereby enhancing the quality of both biobank generation and its retrospective analysis.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Computed Tomography (CT) is a technique that allows the non‐destructive evaluation of internal structures of objects, producing cross‐sectional images. In many situations, it is necessary to explore objects with dimensions larger than the tomographic arrangement. To overcome this situation, it is possible to move the elements of the tomographic array and increase the field of view. One strategy with this objective is scanning with axial movement. To reduce exploration times, axial displacements should be as large as possible, ensuring that all the information necessary to reconstruct the volume with all its characteristics is obtained. This work analyzes the limits applicable to axial movement and its relationship with the geometry of the tomographic array. An analytical expression that measures the values of the axial displacement was obtained. The mathematical expression was validated using synthetic data and real images. The results obtained verify the validity of the proposed expression. In test data sets, it was verified that the use of an axial displacement smaller than the calculated limit ensures the reconstruction of the volume, preserving all its information. Using axial displacements larger than the calculated limit results in missing sections of the volume that are not fully captured.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. The effective preservation and condition assessment of cultural heritage structures require advanced non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques that can identify structural issues without inflicting harm. This study proposes a novel methodology that integrates Infrared Thermography (IRT) with three-dimensional (3D) geometric documentation to create a comprehensive diagnostic system for heritage conservation. The method was applied to walls adjacent to the Library of Pantainos in the Ancient Agora of Athens, Greece. Geometric documentation was achieved through terrestrial surveying and photogrammetric techniques to generate detailed 3D models. For this purpose, non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques were applied. Specifically Infrared Thermography (IRT), high-resolution infrared thermograms were acquired using a thermal camera under controlled environmental conditions and systematically mapped onto the geometric documentation products, enabling precise localization of thermal anomalies and structural deterioration. In addition, digital microscopy (DM) was also employed to categorize stones and mortars. This combined approach allows for precise localization and visualization of thermal anomalies, such as rising damp, material deterioration, and structural weaknesses. In Wall 1, the method identified rising damp accumulation leading to salt crystallization, while in Walls 2 and 3, severe material degradation and thermal stresses were observed. By integrating interdisciplinary data, this technique enhances the accuracy and efficiency of condition assessments, supporting informed conservation decisions. The study demonstrates the significant potential of combining IRT with 3D documentation to improve diagnostic capabilities and offers a robust framework for future applications in cultural heritage conservation.",

    "abstract": "Spectral detection technology offers non-destructive, in situ, and high-speed capabilities, making it widely applicable for detecting biological and chemical samples and quantifying their concentrations. Water resources, essential to life on Earth, are widely distributed across the planet. The application of spectral technology to underwater environments is useful for wide-area water resource monitoring. Although spectral detection technology is well-established, its underwater application presents challenges, including waterproof housing design, power supply, and data transmission, which limit widespread application of underwater spectral detection. Furthermore, underwater spectral detection necessitates the development of compatible computational methods for sample classification or regression analysis. Focusing on underwater spectral detection, this work involved the construction of a suitable hardware system. A compact spectrometer and LEDs (400 nm–800 nm) were employed as the detection and light source modules, respectively, resulting in a compact system architecture. Extensive tests confirmed that the miniaturized design-maintained system performance. Further, this study addressed the estimation of total phosphorus (TP) concentration in water using spectral data. Samples with varying TP concentrations were prepared and calibrated against standard detection instruments. Subsequently, classification algorithms applied to the acquired spectral data enabled the in situ underwater determination of TP concentration in these samples. This work demonstrates the feasibility of underwater spectral detection for future in situ, high-speed monitoring of aquatic biochemical indicators. In the future, after adding UV LED light source, more water quality parameter information can be obtained.",

    "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> In this study, a self-powered triboelectric vibration sensor (TVS) was designed and fabricated to enable non-destructive evaluation of the density of metal 3D-printed specimens. The developed TVS employed a rigid glass substrate combined with an aluminum friction electrode and an electrospun PVDF-TrFE nanofiber layer, which together established a contact-separation-based triboelectric conversion mechanism. The nanofiber layer, characterized by its high porosity and flexibility, was engineered to increase the effective contact area and enhance the sensing sensitivity, while also functioning as a structural cushion to improve mechanical durability.Using this sensor, the vibration attenuation characteristics of metal 3D-printed specimens with different densities (10%, 60%, and 100%) were measured. Under test conditions of 200 Hz frequency and 50 µm amplitude, the results demonstrated a clear linear correlation between the specimen density and the degree of vibration attenuation. The relationship between the TVS output voltage and specimen density was quantified with a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.984, confirming the feasibility of accurate density estimation.These findings indicate that the triboelectric sensor can be extended beyond conventional energy harvesting applications into a practical sensing platform capable of industrial use in structural health monitoring and quality assessment of 3D-printed components. Furthermore, this study provides a concrete example of how TENG technology can contribute to broader commercialization and adoption by demonstrating low-cost, battery-free, and lightweight advantages that enable deployment across diverse industrial settings.",

Post-processing analyses were performed to evaluate the evolution of damage in relation to applied loading. The potential use of Moment Tensor analysis, integrated with the NOESIS neural network and pattern recognition software, is explored to enhance damage characterization. AE data and case studies from previous research projects are presented, demonstrating the correlation between AE event localization and observed crack patterns. Both as-built and retrofitted members were subjected to static and fatigue loading scenarios simulating seismic conditions, with AE monitoring conducted throughout. In all cases, AE monitoring successfully detected damage initiation and progression in real time, enabling characterization of crack development.

This study developed a robust hyperspectral-based framework for non-destructive LNC prediction by combining advanced spectral preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning. Hyperspectral reflectance data were collected across five nitrogen and irrigation treatments over key growth stages. Signal quality was enhanced through Savitzky–Golay smoothing (SG) and Standard Normal Variate normalization (SNV). Key nitrogen-sensitive wavelengths—centered around 725 nm and 730 - 780 nm—were identified using Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Four predictive models were compared, among which a hybrid Stacked Autoencoder–Feedforward Neural Network (SAE-FNN) achieved the highest accuracy (test R² = 0.77, RPD = 2.06), effectively capturing nonlinear spectral–nitrogen interactions. In contrast, Support Vector Machine (SVM) exhibited overfitting and Partial Least Squares Method (PLSR) underperformed due to its linear constraints.

Abstract:Background: Adulteration of herbal medicines is a large-scale issue that compromises the quality, safety, and therapeutic effect of herbal drugs. It entails deliberate substitution, contamination, and incorporation of undeclared synthetic compounds, which often leads to serious adverse health effects. Objectives: This review critically examines the prevalence, character, and public health impact of herbal adulteration. It also specifies present advancements in identification methods and persistent gaps in methods and authentication. Materials and Methods: A critical literature review of world case studies, pharmacopoeial reports were taken. Emphasis was placed on the prevalence of adulteration of widely used herbal medicines. Both traditional methods of analysis (chromatographic and spectroscopic) and the newer tools, like artificial intelligence-based systems for authentication and classification, were considered. Results: Substitution adulteration is the most common, up to 70-90% in prevalent herbs like Coscinium fenestratum, Embelia ribes, and Saraca asoca. Various commercial preparations were detected to contain undeclared synthetic adulterants like corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and sildenafil. Heavy metals, microplastics, and pesticides as impurities add a triple burden of exposure, resulting in oxidative stress, endocrine disruptions, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and microbiome disruption. Though non-destructive, quick authentication techniques, most notably AI-powered image recognition and spectral analysis, are on the horizon, their application in daily quality control is still limited. Conclusion: Harmonized international regulation, more robust quality control measures, and better pharmacovigilance systems are needed urgently. Integrating interdisciplinary collaboration, building capacity, and enhancing consumer education will be key to controlling adulteration and the long-term credibility and safety of herbal medicines.

    "abstract": "Majority of non-destructive testing (NDT) methodologies necessitate access to only one side of the structure. Due to factors such as wave absorption or reflection by the test object, it is necessary to position the transmitter and receiver on different sides of the test surface. This particular investigative modality is designated as tomography. The article reviews the literature on the use of tomography for the inspection of concrete structures, and presents the results of research conducted on the use of GPR in tomographic mode on a bridge support. It is concluded that GPR in tomographic mode is well suited for mapping larger areas with varying concrete quality. Conversely, radiography is particularly well suited to point measurements and is not limited by the influence of dense reinforcement mesh. It has been determined that when employing a suitable radiation source, the risk to human health when utilising this method is negligible. The article examines X-ray tomography and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) techniques, both employing tomographic imaging and requiring access to at least two sides of the structure. It aims to compare the two methods in terms of accuracy and data acquisition, based on the author’s experimental results and evidence from international literature.",

    "summary": "Analyzing nanoparticle size in plasma technology is essential, typically performed using light scattering techniques based on Mie theory, which often require specialized user expertise for data interpretation. This paper introduces a neural network designed to automate the back-calculation of nanoparticle size, addressing this complexity. The network was set up and trained to analyze plasma-grown amorphous carbon nanoparticles, using a kinetic diagnostic approach. Results show that the neural network achieves agreement with prior fitting algorithms while offering higher methodical stability, significantly faster computing speed, and greater automation."

    "title": "An electro-optical bunch profile monitor for FCC-ee",
    "abstract": "The Future Circular Lepton Collider (FCC-ee) presents challenges for a\nlongitudinal bunch profile monitor due to its wide range of bunch lengths and\ncharge densities across its four distinct operational modes. For commissioning,\nmonitoring the top-up injection, and energy calibration, the FCC-ee requires\nnon-destructive, single-shot measurements of the bunch length and profile. This\ncontribution proposes an in-vacuum electro-optical (EO) longitudinal bunch\nprofile monitor for single-shot measurements at high repetition rates, building\non the successful EO monitor at the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator (KARA) at\nthe Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. A novel single-pass conceptual design\nfor the in-vacuum holder of the electro-optical crystal is presented, utilizing\nprisms instead of a mirror to guide the laser through the crystal, which\nadditionally allows measurements of the long bunches foreseen for FCC-ee\noperation mode at the Z-pole energy. A first prototype has been constructed and\ntested at the in-air test stand of the CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for\nResearch (CLEAR). Results from the prototype tests are presented, demonstrating\nthe proof of principle for the single-pass prism-based EO monitor design for\nFCC-ee.",
