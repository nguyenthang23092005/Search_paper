    "title": "Review of Non-Destructive Testing for Wind Turbine Bolts",
    "abstract": "As the world increasingly gravitates towards green, environmentally friendly and low-carbon lifestyles, wind power has become one of the most technologically established renewable energy sources. However, with the continuous increase in their output power and height, wind turbine towers are subjected to higher-intensity alternating wind loads. This makes critical components more prone to fatigue failure, potentially leading to major accidents such as tower buckling or turbine collapse. High-strength bolts play a vital role in supporting towers but are susceptible to fatigue crack initiation under long-term cyclic loading, necessitating regular inspection. Types of wind turbine bolts mainly include high-strength bolts, stainless steel bolts, anchor bolts, titanium alloy bolts, and adjustable bolts. These bolts are distributed across different parts of the turbine and perform distinct functions. Among them, high-strength bolts in the tower are particularly critical for structural support, demanding prioritized periodic inspection. Compared to destructive offline inspection methods requiring bolt disassembly, non-destructive testing (NDT) has emerged as a trend in defect detection technologies. Therefore, this review comprehensively examines various types of NDT techniques for wind turbine towers’ high-strength bolts, including disassembly inspection techniques (magnetic particle inspection, penetration inspection, intelligent torque inspection, etc.) and non-disassembly inspection techniques (ultrasonic inspection, radiographic inspection, infrared thermographic inspection, etc.). For each technique, we analyze the fundamental principles, technical characteristics, and limitations, while emphasizing the interconnections between the methodologies. Finally, we discuss potential future research directions for bolt defect NDT technologies.",

    "title": "Advancing Active Thermography for NDT: The Role of Standardization",
    "abstract": "Infrared thermography, particularly its active form, is increasingly used in various industries in non-destructive testing (NDT). To support its broader adoption, structured standardization efforts have been developed within CEN/TC 138/WG11 and coordinated with ISO. Key standards—such as EN 16714, EN 16714, EN 17119, and EN 17501—define principles, procedures, and equipment requirements. Current activities include finalizing the draft on induction thermography, revising EN 17119, and developing new projects on optical lock-in, laser weld inspection, and thermal diffusivity. Standardization enhances comparability, reliability, and certification, making thermography a robust and scalable solution within the global NDT framework.",

    "title": "Low-Power Vibrothermography for Detecting and Quantifying Defects on CFRP Composites",
    "abstract": "Detecting and quantifying barely visible impact damage (BVID) in carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials is a key challenge in maintaining the safety and reliability of composite structures. This study presents the application of low-power vibrothermography to identify and quantify such defects. Using a long-wave infrared (LWIR) camera, thermal data were captured from the CFRP specimens that inhibit BVID. How image processing, specifically principal component analysis (PCA) and sparse principal component analysis (SPCA), can enhance thermal contrast and improve the accuracy of defect size is also explored. By combining low-energy excitation with advanced data analysis, this research aims to develop a more accessible and reliable approach to non-destructive testing (NDT) for composite materials.",
